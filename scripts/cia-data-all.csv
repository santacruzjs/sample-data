Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing mining and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US its principle trading partner. Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US which absorbs nearly 80% of Canadian exports each year. Canada is the US's largest foreign supplier of energy including oil gas uranium and electric power. Given its great natural resources skilled labor force and modern capital plant Canada has enjoyed solid economic growth and prudent fiscal management has produced consecutive balanced budgets from 1997 to 2007. In 2008 growth slowed sharply as a result of the global economic downturn US housing slump plunging auto sector demand and a drop in world commodity prices. Public finances too are set to deteriorate for the first time in a decade.

Cocoa production has substantially declined in recent years because of drought and mismanagement. Sao Tome has to import all fuels most manufactured goods consumer goods and a substantial amount of food. Over the years it has had difficulty servicing its external debt and has relied heavily on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. Sao Tome benefited from $200 million in debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program which helped bring down the country's $300 million debt burden. In August 2005 Sao Tome signed on to a new 3-year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program worth $4.3 million. Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies.

One-half of its irrigated land is planted in cotton; formerly it was the world's 10th-largest producer. Poor harvests in recent years have led to an almost 50% decline in cotton exports. With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient economy. Privatization goals remain limited. From 1998-2005 Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external debt. At the same time however total exports rose by an average of roughly 15% per year from 2003-08 largely because of higher international oil and gas prices. A new pipeline to China set to come online in late 2009 or early 2010 will give Turkmenistan an additional export route for its gas. Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty a poor educational system government misuse of oil and gas revenues and Ashgabat's reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms. In the past Turkmenistan's economic statistics were state secrets. The new government has established a State Agency for Statistics but GDP numbers and other figures are subject to wide margins of error. In particular the rate of GDP growth is uncertain. Since his election President BERDIMUHAMEDOW has sought to improve the health and education systems unified the country's dual currency exchange rate ordered the redenomination of the manat reduced state subsidies for gasoline increased Internet access both in schools and Internet cafes ordered an independent audit of Turkmenistan's gas resources and created a special tourism zone on the Caspian Sea.

Saint Helena: Uninhabited when first discovered by the Portuguese in 1502 Saint Helena was garrisoned by the British during the 17th century. It acquired fame as the place of Napoleon BONAPARTE's exile from 1815 until his death in 1821 but its importance as a port of call declined after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. During the Anglo-Boer War in South Africa several thousand Boer prisoners were confined on the island between 1900 and 1903. Ascension Island: This barren and uninhabited island was discovered and named by the Portuguese in 1503. The British garrisoned the island in 1815 to prevent a rescue of Napoleon from Saint Helena. It served as a provisioning station for the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron on anti-slavery patrol. The island remained under Admiralty control until 1922 when it became a dependency of Saint Helena. During World War II the UK permitted the US to construct an airfield on Ascension in support of trans-Atlantic flights to Africa and anti-submarine operations in the South Atlantic. In the 1960s the island became an important space tracking station for the US. In 1982 Ascension was an essential staging area for British forces during the Falklands War. It remains a critical refueling point in the air-bridge from the UK to the South Atlantic. Tristan da Cunha: The island group consists of the islands of Tristan da Cunha Nightingale Inaccessible and Gough. Tristan da Cunha is named after its Portuguese discoverer (1506); it was garrisoned by the British in 1816 to prevent any attempt to rescue Napoleon from Saint Helena. Gough and Inaccessible Islands have been designated World Heritage Sites.

By the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in Europe. An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a union through the person of a common ruler. In 1569 Lithuania and Poland formally united into a single dual state the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This entity survived until 1795 when its remnants were partitioned by surrounding countries. Lithuania regained its independence following World War I but was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many other countries. On 11 March 1990 Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence but Moscow did not recognize this proclamation until September of 1991 (following the abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993.

Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French protection in 1863 and it became part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In April 1975 after a five-year struggle Communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution forced hardships or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation and touched off almost 13 years of civil war. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a ceasefire which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government but a second round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders are awaiting trial by a UN-sponsored tribunal for crimes against humanity. Elections in July 2003 were relatively peaceful but it took one year of negotiations between contending political parties before a coalition government was formed. In October 2004 King Norodom SIHANOUK abdicated the throne and his son Prince Norodom SIHAMONI was selected to succeed him. Local elections were held in Cambodia in April 2007 and there was little in the way of pre-election violence that preceded prior elections.

Growth dropped below 7% in 2008 as a result of the global economic slowdown. With the January 2005 expiration of a WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing Cambodian textile producers were forced to compete directly with lower-priced countries such as China India Vietnam and Bangladesh. The garment industry currently employs more than 320 000 people and contributes more than 85% of Cambodia's exports. In 2005 exploitable oil deposits were found beneath Cambodia's territorial waters representing a new revenue stream for the government if commercial extraction begins. Mining also is attracting significant investor interest particularly in the northern parts of the country and the government has said opportunities exist for mining bauxite gold iron and gems. In 2006 a US-Cambodia bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) was signed and several rounds of discussions have been held since 2007. The tourism industry has continued to grow rapidly with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year in 2007-08 however economic troubles abroad will dampen growth in 2009. Rubber exports declined more than 15% in 2008 due to falling world market prices. The global financial crisis is weakening demand for Cambodian exports and construction is declining due to a shortage of credit. The long-term development of the economy remains a daunting challenge. The Cambodian government is working with bilateral and multilateral donors including the World Bank and IMF to address the country's many pressing needs. The major economic challenge for Cambodia over the next decade will be fashioning an economic environment in which the private sector can create enough jobs to handle Cambodia's demographic imbalance. More than 50% of the population is less than 21 years old.

The agricultural sector suffers from frequent drought and poor cultivation practices. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy with exports of some $350 million in 2006 but historically low prices have seen many farmers switching to qat to supplement income. The war with Eritrea in 1998-2000 and recurrent drought have buffeted the economy in particular coffee production. In November 2001 Ethiopia qualified for debt relief from the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and in December 2005 the IMF forgave Ethiopia's debt. Under Ethiopia's constitution the state owns all land and provides long-term leases to the tenants; the system continues to hamper growth in the industrial sector as entrepreneurs are unable to use land as collateral for loans.

Midway Atoll NWR has been included in a Refuge Complex with the Hawaiian Islands NWR and also designated as part of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. These remote refuges are the most widespread collection of marine- and terrestrial-life protected areas on the planet under a single country's jurisdiction. They sustain many endemic species including corals fish shellfish marine mammals seabirds water birds land birds insects and vegetation not found elsewhere. Baker Island: The US took possession of the island in 1857. Its guano deposits were mined by US and British companies during the second half of the 19th century. In 1935 a short-lived attempt at colonization began on this island but was disrupted by World War II and thereafter abandoned. The island was established as a NWR in 1974. Howland Island: Discovered by the US early in the 19th century the uninhabited atoll was officially claimed by the US in 1857. Both US and British companies mined for guano deposits until about 1890. In 1935 a short-lived attempt at colonization began on this island similar to the effort on nearby Baker Island but was disrupted by World War II and thereafter abandoned. The famed American aviatrix Amelia EARHART disappeared while seeking out Howland Island as a refueling stop during her 1937 round-the-world flight; Earhart Light a day beacon near the middle of the west coast was named in her memory. The island was established as a NWR in 1974. Jarvis Island: First discovered by the British in 1821 the uninhabited island was annexed by the US in 1858 but abandoned in 1879 after tons of guano had been removed. The UK annexed the island in 1889 but never carried out plans for further exploitation. The US occupied and reclaimed the island in 1935. It was abandoned in 1942 during World War II. The island was established as a NWR in 1974. Johnston Atoll: Both the US and the Kingdom of Hawaii annexed Johnston Atoll in 1858 but it was the US that mined the guano deposits until the late 1880s. Johnston and Sand Islands were designated wildlife refuges in 1926. The US Navy took over the atoll in 1934. Subsequently the US Air Force assumed control in 1948. The site was used for high-altitude nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s. Until late in 2000 the atoll was maintained as a storage and disposal site for chemical weapons. Munitions destruction cleanup and closure of the facility were completed by May 2005. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the US Air Force are currently discussing future management options; in the interim Johnston Atoll and the three-mile Naval Defensive Sea around it remain under the jurisdiction and administrative control of the US Air Force. Kingman Reef: The US annexed the reef in 1922. Its sheltered lagoon served as a way station for flying boats on Hawaii-to-American Samoa flights during the late 1930s. There are no terrestrial plants on the reef which is frequently awash but it does support abundant and diverse marine fauna and flora. In 2001 the waters surrounding the reef out to 12 nm were designated a US NWR. Midway Islands: The US took formal possession of the islands in 1867. The laying of the trans-Pacific cable which passed through the islands brought the first residents in 1903. Between 1935 and 1947 Midway was used as a refueling stop for trans-Pacific flights. The US naval victory over a Japanese fleet off Midway in 1942 was one of the turning points of World War II. The islands continued to serve as a naval station until closed in 1993. Today the islands are a NWR and are the site of the world's largest Laysan albatross colony. Palmyra Atoll: The Kingdom of Hawaii claimed the atoll in 1862 and the US included it among the Hawaiian Islands when it annexed the archipelago in 1898. The Hawaii Statehood Act of 1959 did not include Palmyra Atoll which is now partly privately owned by the Nature Conservancy with the rest owned by the Federal government and managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. These organizations are managing the atoll as a wildlife refuge. The lagoons and surrounding waters within the 12 nm US territorial seas were transferred to the US Fish and Wildlife Service and designated as a NWR in January 2001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Baker Howland and Jarvis Islands: equatorial; scant rainfall constant wind burning sun Johnston Atoll and Kingman Reef: tropical but generally dry; consistent northeast trade winds with little seasonal temperature variation Midway Islands: subtropical with cool moist winters (December to February) and warm dry summers (May to October); moderated by prevailing easterly winds; most of the 1 067 mm (42 in) of annual rainfall occurs during the winter Palmyra Atoll: equatorial hot; located within the low pressure area of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where the northeast and southeast trade winds meet it is extremely wet with between 4 000-5 000 mm (160-200 in) of rainfall each year,,,,,,terrestrial and aquatic wildlife,,,Baker Howland and Jarvis Islands: scattered vegetation consisting of grasses prostrate vines and low growing shrubs; primarily a nesting roosting and foraging habitat for seabirds shorebirds and marine wildlife; closed to the public Johnston Atoll: Johnston Island and Sand Island are natural islands which have been expanded by coral dredging; North Island (Akau) and East Island (Hikina) are manmade islands formed from coral dredging; the egg-shaped reef is 34 km in circumference; closed to the public Kingman Reef: barren coral atoll with deep interior lagoon; closed to the public Midway Islands: a coral atoll managed as a NWR and open to the public for wildlife-related recreation in the form of wildlife observation and photography Palmyra Atoll: the high rainfall and resulting lush vegetation make the environment of this atoll unique among the US Pacific Island territories; supports a large undisturbed stand of Pisonia beach forest,,no economic activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,NA,Baker Howland and Jarvis Islands: the narrow fringing reef surrounding the island can be a maritime hazard Kingman Reef: wet or awash most of the time maximum elevation of less than 2 m makes Kingman Reef a maritime hazard Midway Islands Johnston and Palmyra Atolls: NA,Baker Island: about two and a half times the size of The Mall in Washington DC Howland Island: about three times the size of The Mall in Washington DC Jarvis Island: about eight times the size of The Mall in Washington DC Johnston Atoll: about four and a half times the size of The Mall in Washington DC Kingman Reef: a little more than one and a half times the size of The Mall in Washington DC Midway Islands: about nine times the size of The Mall in Washington DC Palmyra Atoll: about 20 times the size of The Mall in Washington DC,,,,,,the laws of the US where applicable apply,,12.0,NA,,,,,,Baker Howland and Jarvis Islands and Johnston Atoll: no natural fresh water resources Kingman Reef: none Midway Islands and Palmyra Atoll: NA,,,,,,,,,Baker Howland and Jarvis Islands and Kingman Reef: none; offshore anchorage only Johnston Atoll: Johnston Island Midway Islands: Sand Island Palmyra Atoll: West Lagoon,,,,,low and nearly level sandy coral islands with narrow fringing reefs that have developed at the top of submerged volcanic mountains which in most cases rise steeply from the ocean floor,,,,,,,the flag of the US is used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none (territories of the US),,,,

The manufacturing sector has diversified since the mid-1980s. Sugar and wood pulp remain important foreign exchange earners. In 2007 the sugar industry increased efficiency and diversification efforts in response to a 17% decline in EU sugar prices. Mining has declined in importance in recent years with only coal and quarry stone mines remaining active. Surrounded by South Africa except for a short border with Mozambique Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa from which it receives more than nine-tenths of its imports and to which it sends 60% of its exports. Swaziland's currency is pegged to the South African rand subsuming Swaziland's monetary policy to South Africa. Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union which may equal as much as 70% of government revenue this year and worker remittances from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income. Swaziland is not poor enough to merit an IMF program; however the country is struggling to reduce the size of the civil service and control costs at public enterprises. The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for foreign investment. With an estimated 40% unemployment rate Swaziland's need to increase the number and size of small and medium enterprises and attract foreign direct investment is acute.

After Bolivia Paraguay and Uruguay went their separate ways the area that remained became Argentina. The country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants from throughout Europe but most particularly Italy and Spain which provided the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up until about the mid-20th century much of Argentina's history was dominated by periods of internal political conflict between Federalists and Unitarians and between civilian and military factions. After World War II an era of Peronist populism and direct and indirect military interference in subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power in 1976.

Although one of the world's wealthiest countries 100 years ago Argentina suffered during most of the 20th century from recurring economic crises persistent fiscal and current account deficits high inflation mounting external debt and capital flight. A severe depression growing public and external indebtedness and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious economic social and political crisis in the country's turbulent history. Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default - the largest in history - on the government's foreign debt in December of that year and abruptly resigned only a few days after taking office. His successor Eduardo DUHALDE announced an end to the peso's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002. The economy bottomed out that year with real GDP 18% smaller than in 1998 and almost 60% of Argentines under the poverty line. Real GDP rebounded to grow by an average 9% annually over the subsequent five years taking advantage of previously idled industrial capacity and labor an audacious debt restructuring and reduced debt burden excellent international financial conditions and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Inflation also increased however during the administration of President Nestor KIRCHNER which responded with price restraints on businesses as well as export taxes and restraints and beginning in early 2007 with understating inflation data. Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as President in late 2007 but was stymied in her efforts to hike export taxes still further by protesting farmers.

Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early 1980s reforms spurred private investment stimulated economic growth and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was characterized by political instability racial tensions and violent protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large northern hemisphere markets. In 2005 the government passed a controversial hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts to surrender all production to the state energy company. In early 2008 higher earnings for mining and hydrocarbons exports pushed the current account surplus to 9.4% of GDP and the government's higher tax take produced a fiscal surplus after years of large deficits. Private investment as a share of GDP however remains among the lowest in Latin America and inflation remained at double-digit levels in 2008.

Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every election since then. Burkina Faso's high population density and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens. Recent unrest in Cote d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of several hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find employment in neighboring countries.

About 90% of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture which is vulnerable to periodic drought. Cotton is the main cash crop and the government has joined with three other cotton producing countries in the region - Mali Niger and Chad - to lobby in the World Trade Organization for fewer subsidies to producers in other competing countries. Since 1998 Burkina Faso has embarked upon a gradual but successful privatization of state-owned enterprises. Having revised its investment code in 2004 Burkina Faso hopes to attract foreign investors. Thanks to this new code and other legislation favoring the mining sector the country has seen an upswing in gold exploration and production. While the bitter internal crisis in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire is beginning to be resolved it is still having a negative effect on Burkina Faso's trade and employment.

Even so Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial and technical assistance. Gold and cocoa production and individual remittances are major sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to revolve around agriculture which accounts for about 35% of GDP and employs about 55% of the work force mainly small landholders. Ghana signed a Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact in 2006 which aims to assist in transforming Ghana's agricultural sector. Ghana opted for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) program in 2002 and is also benefiting from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative that took effect in 2006. Thematic priorities under its current Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy which also provides the framework for development partner assistance are: macroeconomic stability; private sector competitiveness; human resource development; and good governance and civic responsibility.

The king's official title is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi state was founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman AL SAUD (Ibn Saud) after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula. A male descendent of Ibn Saud his son ABDALLAH bin Abd al-Aziz rules the country today as required by the country's 1992 Basic Law. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400 000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a source of tension between the royal family and the public until all operational US troops left the country in 2003. Major terrorist attacks in May and November 2003 spurred a strong on-going campaign against domestic terrorism and extremism. King ABDALLAH has continued the cautious reform program begun when he was crown prince. To promote increased political participation the government held elections nationwide from February through April 2005 for half the members of 179 municipal councils. In December 2005 King ABDALLAH completed the process by appointing the remaining members of the advisory municipal councils. The king instituted an Inter-Faith Dialogue initiative in 2008 to encourage religious tolerance on a global level; in February 2009 he reshuffled the cabinet which led to more moderates holding ministerial and judicial positions and appointed the first female to the cabinet. The country remains a leading producer of oil and natural gas and holds more than 20% of the world's proven oil reserves. The government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the WTO in December 2005 and promotes foreign investment in the kingdom.

It possesses more than 20% of the world's proven petroleum reserves ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum and plays a leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 80% of budget revenues 45% of GDP and 90% of export earnings. About 40% of GDP comes from the private sector. Roughly 6.4 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy particularly in the oil and service sectors. High oil prices through mid-2008 have boosted growth government revenues and Saudi ownership of foreign assets while enabling Riyadh to pay down domestic debt. The government is encouraging private sector growth - especially in power generation telecommunications natural gas exploration and petrochemicals - to lessen the kingdom's dependence on oil exports and to increase employment opportunities for the swelling Saudi population nearly 40% of which are youths under 15 years old.

The economy is service-oriented with commerce transport tourism and public services accounting for about three-fourths of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas the share of food production in GDP is low. About 82% of food must be imported. The fishing potential mostly lobster and tuna is not fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit financed by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances supplement GDP by more than 20%. Economic reforms are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.

With the highest per capita GDP in Central Europe Slovenia has excellent infrastructure a well-educated work force and a strategic location between the Balkans and Western Europe. Privatization has lagged since 2002 and the economy has one of highest levels of state control in the EU. Structural reforms to improve the business environment have allowed for somewhat greater foreign participation in Slovenia's economy and have helped to lower unemployment. In March 2004 Slovenia became the first transition country to graduate from borrower status to donor partner at the World Bank. In December 2007 Slovenia was invited to begin the accession process for joining the OECD. Despite its economic success foreign direct investment (FDI) in Slovenia has lagged behind the region average and taxes remain relatively high. Furthermore the labor market is often seen as inflexible and legacy industries are losing sales to more competitive firms in China India and elsewhere.,1928000,2007,25 June 1991 (from Yugoslavia),0,2007 est.,1073000000,2005,1105000000,2006 est.,0.9,2002 census,$ -2 920 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,6140000000.0,2007 est.,-0.6,NA,$ 41 630 000 000,31 December 2007,,,390559.0,2009 est.,Independence Day/Statehood Day 25 June (1991),29,2008,0.0,NA,flooding; earthquakes,slightly smaller than New Jersey,99.7,NA,76.92,2009 est.,bicameral Parliament consists of a National Council or Drzavni Svet (40 seats; members indirectly elected by an electoral college to serve five-year terms; note - this is primarily an advisory body with limited legislative powers; it may propose laws ask to review any National Assembly decision and call national referenda) and the National Assembly or Drzavni Zbor (90 seats; 40 members are directly elected and 50 are elected on a proportional basis; note - the number of directly elected and proportionally elected seats varies with each election; the constitution mandates 1 seat each for Slovenia's Hungarian and Italian minorities; members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: National Assembly - last held 21 September 2008 (next to be held 8 October 2012) election results: percent of vote by party - SD 30.5% SDS 29.3% ZARES 9.4% DeSUS 7.5% SNS 5.5% SLS+SMS 5.2% LDS 5.2% other 7.4%; seats by party - SD 29 SDS 28 ZARES 9 DeSUS 7 SNS 5 SLS+SMS 5 LDS 5 Hungarian minority 1 Italian minority 1,based on civil law system; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,Australia Group BIS CE CEI EAPC EBRD EIB EMU EU FAO IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITU MIGA NAM (guest) NATO NSG OAS (observer) OECD (accession state) OIF (observer) OPCW OSCE PCA Schengen Convention SECI UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNIFIL UNTSO UNWTO UPU WCO WEU (associate partner) WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO ZC,12.0,NA,481180.0,2008 est.,1.7,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants Air Pollution-Sulfur 94 Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,Sava River polluted with domestic and industrial waste; pollution of coastal waters with heavy metals and toxic chemicals; forest damage near Koper from air pollution (originating at metallurgical and chemical plants) and resulting acid rain,2.0,2008,1.0,2008,14130000000,2007 est.,1228,2007,Koper,18.0,NA,1.7,2008 est.,a short coastal strip on the Adriatic an alpine mountain region adjacent to Italy and Austria mixed mountains and valleys with numerous rivers to the east,general assessment: well-developed telecommunications infrastructure domestic: combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 140 telephones per 100 persons international: country code - 386,1.28,2009 est.,6.7,2008 est.,parliamentary republic,three equal horizontal bands of white (top) blue and red with the Slovenian seal (a shield with the image of Triglav Slovenia's highest peak in white against a blue background at the center; beneath it are two wavy blue lines depicting seas and rivers and above it are three six-pointed stars arranged in an inverted triangle which are taken from the coat of arms of the Counts of Celje the great Slovene dynastic house of the late 14th and early 15th centuries); the seal is in the upper hoist side of the flag centered on the white and blue bands,minor transit point for cocaine and Southwest Asian heroin bound for Western Europe and for precursor chemicals,$ 33 430 000 000,2008 est.,38709,2007,-0.11,2009 est.,4.3,2008 est.,,,$ 59 140 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador (vacant); Charge d'Affaires Brad FREDEN embassy: Presernova 31 1000 Ljubljana mailing address: American Embassy Ljubljana US Department of State 7140 Ljubljana Place Washington DC 20521-7140 telephone: [386] (1) 200-5500 FAX: [386] (1) 200-5555,$ 29 500,2008 est.,4000000,2006 est.

The agricultural sector accounts for about one-tenth of GDP two-fifths of exports and half of the labor force. Coffee sugar and bananas are the main products with sugar exports benefiting from increased global demand for ethanol. The 1996 signing of peace accords which ended 36 years of civil war removed a major obstacle to foreign investment and Guatemala since then has pursued important reforms and macroeconomic stabilization. The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) entered into force in July 2006 and has since spurred increased investment in the export sector but concerns over security the lack of skilled workers and poor infrastructure continued to hamper foreign participation. The distribution of income remains highly unequal with more than half of the population below the national poverty line. Other ongoing challenges include increasing government revenues negotiating further assistance from international donors curtailing drug trafficking and rampant crime and narrowing the trade deficit. Given Guatemala's large expatriate community in the United States it is the top remittance recipient in Central America with inflows serving as a primary source of foreign income equivalent to nearly two-thirds of exports. Economic growth will slow in 2009 as export demand from US and other Central American markets drop and foreign investment slows amid the global slowdown.,10150000,2007,15 September 1821 (from Spain),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,,,$ -2 119 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,8110000.0,2007 est.,3.4,NA,$ 13 960 000 000,31 December 2007,,,2401297.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 15 September (1821),,,0.0,NA,numerous volcanoes in mountains with occasional violent earthquakes; Caribbean coast extremely susceptible to hurricanes and other tropical storms,slightly smaller than Tennessee,69.1,2002 census,70.29,2009 est.,unicameral Congress of the Republic or Congreso de la Republica (158 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 9 September 2007 (next to be held in September 2011) election results: percent of vote by party - UNE 30.4% GANA 23.4% PP 18.9% FRG 9.5% PU 5.1% other 12.7%; seats by party - UNE 48 GANA 37 PP 30 FRG 15 PU 8 CASA 5 EG 4 PAN 4 UCN 4 URNG 2 UD 1,civil law system; judicial review of legislative acts; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,BCIE CACM FAO G-24 G-77 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU ITUC LAES LAIA (observer) MIGA MINUSTAH MONUC NAM OAS OPANAL OPCW PCA RG SICA UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNIFIL Union Latina UNMIS UNOCI UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,2861696.0,2008 est.,0.4,2006,party to: Antarctic Treaty Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,deforestation in the Peten rainforest; soil erosion; water pollution,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,7643000000,2006 est.,332,2008,Puerto Quetzal Santo Tomas de Castilla,18.0,NA,1.4,2008 est.,mostly mountains with narrow coastal plains and rolling limestone plateau,general assessment: fairly modern network centered in the city of Guatemala domestic: state-owned telecommunications company privatized in the late 1990s opening the way for competition; fixed-line teledensity 11 per 100 persons; fixed-line investments are being concentrated on improving rural connectivity; mobile-cellular teledensity 80 per 100 persons international: country code - 502; landing point for both the Americas Region Caribbean Ring System (ARCOS-1) and the SAM-1 fiber optic submarine cable system that together provide connectivity to South and Central America parts of the Caribbean and the US; connected to Central American Microwave System; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean),3.47,2009 est.,3.2,2005 est.,constitutional democratic republic,three equal vertical bands of light blue (hoist side) white and light blue with the coat of arms centered in the white band; the coat of arms includes a green and red quetzal (the national bird) and a scroll bearing the inscription LIBERTAD 15 DE SEPTIEMBRE DE 1821 (the original date of independence from Spain) all superimposed on a pair of crossed rifles and a pair of crossed swords and framed by a wreath,major transit country for cocaine and heroin; in 2005 cultivated 100 hectares of opium poppy after reemerging as a potential source of opium in 2004; potential production of less than 1 metric ton of pure heroin; marijuana cultivation for mostly domestic consumption; proximity to Mexico makes Guatemala a major staging area for drugs (particularly for cocaine); money laundering is a serious problem; corruption is a major problem,$ 13 380 000 000,2008 est.,14095,2000,2.07,2009 est.,3.8,2008 est.,,,$ 68 020 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Stephen G.

The Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia and Montenegro - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a ""Greater Serbia."" In March 1994 Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement creating a joint Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995 in Dayton Ohio the warring parties initialed a peace agreement that brought to a halt three years of interethnic civil strife (the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Peace Accords retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's international boundaries and created a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government charged with conducting foreign diplomatic and fiscal policy. Also recognized was a second tier of government comprised of two entities roughly equal in size: the Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska (RS). The Federation and RS governments were charged with overseeing most government functions. The Office of the High Representative (OHR) was established to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. In 1995-96 a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60 000 troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement.

With an uneasy peace in place output recovered in 1996-99 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000-02. Part of the lag in output was made up in 2003-08 when GDP growth exceeded 5% per year. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all the Communist-era payments bureaus were shut down; foreign banks primarily from Western Europe now control most of the banking sector. The konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM)- the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has increased. Bosnia's private sector is growing and foreign investment is slowly increasing but government spending at nearly 40% of adjusted GDP remains high because of redundant government offices at the state entity and municipal level. Implementing privatization however has been slow particularly in the Federation where political division between ethnically-based political parties makes agreement on economic policy more difficult. A sizeable current account deficit and high unemployment rate remain the two most serious macroeconomic problems. Successful implementation of a value-added tax in 2006 provided a predictable source of revenue for the government and helped rein in gray market activity. National-level statistics have also improved over time but a large share of economic activity remains unofficial and unrecorded. Bosnia and Herzegovina became a full member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement in September 2007. Bosnia's economy has been largely sheltered from the global financial downtown although key economic indicators have worsened. Key exporters in the metal automobile and wood processing industries have reported a worsening performance and have announced layoffs and output reductions.,2450000,2007,1 March 1992 (from Yugoslavia; referendum for independence completed 1 March 1992; independence declared 3 March 1992),0,2007 est.,,,400000000,2006 est.,14.0,NA,$ -2 763 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,3015000000.0,2006 est.,1.4,NA,$ 8 895 000 000,31 December 2007,,,959226.0,2009 est.,National Day 25 November (1943),,,0.0,NA,destructive earthquakes,slightly smaller than West Virginia,96.7,2000 est.,78.5,2009 est.,bicameral Parliamentary Assembly or Skupstina consists of the House of Peoples or Dom Naroda (15 seats 5 Bosniak 5 Croat 5 Serb; members elected by the Bosniak/Croat Federation's House of Representatives and the Republika Srpska's National Assembly to serve four-year terms); and the national House of Representatives or Predstavnicki Dom (42 seats 28 seats allocated for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 14 seats for the Republika Srpska; members elected by popular vote on the basis of proportional representation to serve four-year terms); note - Bosnia's election law specifies four-year terms for the state and first-order administrative division entity legislatures elections: House of Peoples - last constituted in January 2003 (next to be constituted in 2007); national House of Representatives - elections last held 1 October 2006 (next to be held in 2010) election results: House of Peoples - percent of vote by party/coalition - NA; seats by party/coalition - NA; national House of Representatives - percent of vote by party/coalition - NA; seats by party/coalition - SDA 9 SBiH 8 SNSD 7 SDP 5 SDS 3 HDZ-BH 3 HDZ1990 2 other 5 note: the Bosniak/Croat Federation has a bicameral legislature that consists of a House of Peoples (58 seats - 17 Bosniak 17 Croat 17 Serb 7 other); last constituted December 2002; and a House of Representatives (98 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms); elections last held 1 October 2006 (next to be held in October 2010); percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party/coalition - SDA 28 SBiH 24 SDP 17 HDZ-BH 8 HDZ1990 7 other 14; the Republika Srpska has a National Assembly (83 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms); elections last held 1 October 2006 (next to be held in the fall of 2010); percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party/coalition - SNSD 41 SDS 17 PDP 8 DNS 4 SBiH 4 SPRS 3 SDA 3 other 3; as a result of the 2002 constitutional reform process a 28-member Republika Srpska Council of Peoples (COP) was established in the Republika Srpska National Assembly including eight Croats eight Bosniaks eight Serbs and four members of the smaller communities,based on civil law system; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,BIS CE CEI EAPC EBRD FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MONUC NAM (observer) OAS (observer) OIC (observer) OPCW OSCE PFP SECI UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO (observer),,,1170645.0,2008 est.,4.5,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,air pollution from metallurgical plants; sites for disposing of urban waste are limited; water shortages and destruction of infrastructure because of the 1992-95 civil strife; deforestation,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,12840000000,2006 est.,1000,2008,Bosanska Gradiska Bosanski Brod Bosanski Samac and Brcko (all inland waterway ports on the Sava River) Orasje,18.0,NA,11.6,2008 est.,mountains and valleys,general assessment: post-war reconstruction of the telecommunications network aided by a internationally sponsored program under ERBD resulted in sharp increases in the number of main telephone lines available; mobile cellular subscribership has been increasing rapidly domestic: fixed-line teledensity roughly 25 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone density exceeds 50 per 100 persons international: country code - 387; no satellite earth stations (2007),1.25,2009 est.,29.0,2007 est.,emerging federal democratic republic,a wide medium blue vertical band on the fly side with a yellow isosceles triangle abutting the band and the top of the flag; the remainder of the flag is medium blue with seven full five-pointed white stars and two half stars top and bottom along the hypotenuse of the triangle,increasingly a transit point for heroin being trafficked to Western Europe; minor transit point for marijuana; remains highly vulnerable to money-laundering activity given a primarily cash-based and unregulated economy weak law enforcement and instances of corruption,$ 12 270 000 000,2008 est.,21846,2006,0.34,2009 est.,5.6,2008 est.,5.0,2007,$ 29 900 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Charles L.

Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP 95% of export revenues and 80% of government income. Kuwait experienced rapid economic growth over the last several years on the back of high oil prices and in 2008 posted its tenth consecutive budget surplus. As a result of this positive fiscal situation the need for economic reforms was less urgent and the government did not push through new initiatives. The drop in oil prices in late 2008 will reduce Kuwait's fiscal surplus in 2009.

Britain separated out a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan from Palestine in the early 1920s and the area gained its independence in 1946; it adopted the name of Jordan in 1950. The country's long-time ruler was King HUSSEIN (1953-99). A pragmatic leader he successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US USSR and UK) various Arab states Israel and a large internal Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 war and barely managed to defeat Palestinian rebels who threatened to overthrow the monarchy in 1970. King HUSSEIN in 1988 permanently relinquished Jordanian claims to the West Bank. In 1989 he reinstituted parliamentary elections and initiated a gradual political liberalization; political parties were legalized in 1992. In 1994 he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II the son of King HUSSEIN assumed the throne following his father's death in February 1999. Since then he has consolidated his power and undertaken an aggressive economic reform program. Jordan acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2000 and began to participate in the European Free Trade Association in 2001. In 2003 Jordan staunchly supported the Coalition ouster of Saddam in Iraq and following the outbreak of insurgent violence in Iraq absorbed thousands of displaced Iraqis. Municipal elections were held in July 2007 under a system in which 20% of seats in all municipal councils were reserved by quota for women. Parliamentary elections were held in November 2007 and saw independent pro-government candidates win the vast majority of seats. In November 2007 King ABDALLAH instructed his new prime minister to focus on socioeconomic reform developing a healthcare and housing network for civilians and military personnel and improving the educational system.,2.7,2001 est.,clothing fertilizers potash phosphates vegetables pharmaceuticals,,,2.75,July 2009 est.,49.0,2008,$ 19 120 000 000,2008 est.,$ 16 500 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,,,12 governorates (muhafazat singular - muhafazah); Ajlun Al 'Aqabah Al Balqa' Al Karak Al Mafraq 'Amman At Tafilah Az Zarqa' Irbid Jarash Ma'an Madaba,0.9,1997,1.01,2000,citrus tomatoes cucumbers olives; sheep poultry stone fruits strawberries dairy,Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF): Royal Jordanian Land Force (RJLF) Royal Jordanian Navy Royal Jordanian Air Force (Al-Quwwat al-Jawwiya al-Malakiya al-Urduniya RJAF) Special Operations Command (Socom); Public Security Directorate (normally falls under Ministry of Interior but comes under JAF in wartime or crisis) (2008),19.55,2009 est.,4.9,1999,$ 5 670 000 000,2008 est.,mostly arid desert; rainy season in west (November to April),crude oil machinery transport equipment iron cereals,Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party [Fuad DABBOUR]; Ba'ath Arab Progressive Party [Tayseer al-HAMSI]; Call Party [Mohammed Abu BAKR]; Democratic People's Party [Ahmad Yusuf 'ALIYA]; Democratic Popular Unity Party [Sa'ed DIAB]; Islamic Action Front or IAF [Ishaq al-FARHAN]; Islamic Center Party [Marwan al-FA'OURI; Jordanian Communist Party [Munir HAMARNEH]; Jordanian National Party [Mona Abu BAKR]; Jordanian United Front [Amjad al-MAJALI]; Life Party [Thaher 'AMROU]; Message Party [Hazem QASHOU]; National Constitution Party [Ahmed al-SHUNAQ]; National Movement for Direct Democracy [Mohammed al-QAQ];,6342948,July 2009 est.,noun: Jordanian(s) adjective: Jordanian,phosphates potash shale oil,5.83,2009 est.,strategic location at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba and as the Arab country that shares the longest border with Israel and the occupied West Bank,Anti-Normalization Committee [Ali Abu SUKKAR president vice chairman]; Jordan Bar Association [Saleh al-ARMUTI chairman]; Jordanian Press Association [Sayf al-SHARIF president]; Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood [Dr. Hamam SAID controller general],Jordan is a small Arab country with insufficient supplies of water oil and other natural resources. Poverty unemployment and inflation are fundamental problems but King ABDALLAH II since assuming the throne in 1999 has undertaken some broad economic reforms in a long-term effort to improve living standards. Since Jordan's graduation from its most recent IMF program in 2002 Amman has continued to follow IMF guidelines practicing careful monetary policy making substantial headway with privatization and opening the trade regime. Jordan's exports have significantly increased under the free trade accord with the US and Jordanian Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) which allow Jordan to export goods with some Israeli content duty free to the US. In 2006 and 2008 Jordan used privatization proceeds to significantly reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio. These measures have helped improve productivity and have made Jordan more attractive for foreign investment. The government ended subsidies for petroleum and other consumer goods in 2008 in an effort to control the budget. The main challenges facing Jordan are reducing dependence on foreign grants reducing the growing budget deficit attracting investments and creating jobs. Jordan is currently exploring nuclear power generation to forestall energy shortfalls. Jordan's conservative banking sector has been largely protected from the worldwide financial crisis but many businesses particularly in the tourism and real estate sector are predicting a slow-down in 2009.,4771000,2007,25 May 1946 (from League of Nations mandate under British administration),0,2007 est.,2400000000,2007 est.,2250000000,2006 est.,2.0,NA,$ -2 425 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,472000000.0,2006 est.,3.1,NA,$ 19 530 000 000,31 December 2007,,,1382097.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 25 May (1946),21,2008,-408.0,NA,droughts; periodic earthquakes,slightly smaller than Indiana,89.9,2003 est.,78.87,2009 est.,bicameral National Assembly or Majlis al-'Umma consists of the Senate also called the House of Notables or Majlis al-Ayan (55 seats; members appointed by the monarch to serve four-year terms) and the Chamber of Deputies also called the House of Representatives or Majlis al-Nuwaab (110 seats; members elected using a single non-transferable vote system in multi-member districts to serve four-year terms); note - six seats are reserved for women nine seats are reserved for Christian candidates nine seats are reserved for Bedouin candidates and three seats are reserved for Jordanians of Chechen or Circassian descent elections: Chamber of Deputies - last held 20 November 2007 (next scheduled to be held in 2011) election results: Chamber of Deputies - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - IAF 6 independents and other 104; note - seven women serve in the Assembly six of whom filled women's quota seats and one was directly elected,based on Islamic law and French codes; judicial review of legislative acts in a specially provided High Tribunal; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ABEDA AFESD AMF CAEU FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAS MIGA MINURCAT MINUSTAH MONUC NAM OIC OPCW OSCE (partner) PCA UN UNAMID UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNMIL UNMIS UNOCI UNOMIG UNRWA UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,3.0,NA,1559155.0,2008 est.,8.6,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,limited natural fresh water resources; deforestation; overgrazing; soil erosion; desertification,2.0,2008,1.0,2008,10080000000,2007 est.,507,2008,Al 'Aqabah,18.0,NA,5.7,2008 est.,mostly desert plateau in east highland area in west; Great Rift Valley separates East and West Banks of the Jordan River,general assessment: service has improved recently with increased use of digital switching equipment; microwave radio relay transmission and coaxial and fiber-optic cable are employed on trunk lines; growing mobile-cellular usage in both urban and rural areas is reducing use of fixed-line services; Internet penetration remains modest and slow-growing domestic: 1995 telecommunications law opened all non-fixed-line services to private competition; in 2005 monopoly over fixed-line services terminated and the entire telecommunications sector was opened to competition; mobile-cellular usage is increasing rapidly and teledensity reached 80 per 100 persons in 2007 international: country code - 962; landing point for the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) submarine cable network that provides links to Asia Middle East Europe; satellite earth stations - 33 (3 Intelsat 1 Arabsat and 29 land and maritime Inmarsat terminals); fiber-optic cable to Saudi Arabia and microwave radio relay link with Egypt and Syria; participant in Medarabtel (2007),2.39,2009 est.,12.6,2008 est.,constitutional monarchy,three equal horizontal bands of black (top) representing the Abbassid Caliphate white representing the Ummayyad Caliphate and green representing the Fatimid Caliphate; a red isosceles triangle on the hoist side representing the Great Arab Revolt of 1916 and bearing a small white seven-pointed star symbolizing the seven verses of the opening Sura (Al-Fatiha) of the Holy Koran; the seven points on the star represent faith in One God humanity national spirit humility social justice virtue and aspirations; design is based on the Arab Revolt flag of World War I,,$ 15 030 000 000,2008 est.,8002,2007,2.26,2009 est.,5.8,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 30 760 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Robert S.

St. Barthelemy retained its free port status along with various Swedish appellations such as Swedish street and town names and the three-crown symbol on the coat of arms.

Spain's mixed capitalist economy supports a GDP that on a per capita basis is approaching that of the largest West European economies. The Socialist president Jose Luis Rodriguez ZAPATERO in office since 2004 has made mixed progress in carrying out key structural reforms. The economy was greatly affected especially after Zapatero's second term began in April 2008 by the bursting of the housing bubble and construction boom that had fueled much of the economic growth between 2001 and 2007. The global financial crisis exacerbated the economic downturn. GDP growth in 2008 was 1.1% well below the 3% or higher growth the country enjoyed from 1997 through 2007. The Spanish banking system is considered solid thanks in part to conservative oversight by the European Central Bank and government intervention to rescue banks on the scale seen elsewhere in Europe in 2008 was not necessary.

William TUBMAN president from 1944-71 did much to promote foreign investment and to bridge the economic social and political gaps between the descendents of the original settlers and the inhabitants of the interior. In 1980 a military coup led by Samuel DOE ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In December 1989 Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's regime that led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE himself was killed. A period of relative peace in 1997 allowed for elections that brought TAYLOR to power but major fighting resumed in 2000. An August 2003 peace agreement ended the war and prompted the resignation of former president Charles TAYLOR who faces war crimes charges in The Hague related to his involvement in Sierra Leone's civil war. After two years of rule by a transitional government democratic elections in late 2005 brought President Ellen JOHNSON SIRLEAF to power.

The native Taino Indians who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries were gradually exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England seized the island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar cocoa and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica gradually obtained increasing independence from Britain. In 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew from the Federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money laundering. Violent crime drug trafficking and poverty pose significant challenges to the government today.

The country continues to derive most of its foreign exchange from tourism remittances and bauxite/alumina. Remittances account for nearly 20% of GDP and are equivalent to tourism revenues. Jamaica's economy already saddled with the lowest economic growth in Latin America will face increasing difficulties as the global economy slows. The economy faces serious long-term problems: a sizable merchandise trade deficit large-scale unemployment and underemployment and a debt-to-GDP ratio of almost 130%. Jamaica's onerous debt burden - the fourth highest per capita - is the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy most notably the financial sector in the mid-to-late 1990s. It hinders government spending on infrastructure and social programs as debt servicing accounts for nearly half of government expenditures. Inflation rose sharply in 2008 as a result of high prices for imported food and oil and should fall in 2009 with the decline in international oil prices. High unemployment exacerbates the serious crime problem including gang violence that is fueled by the drug trade. The GOLDING administration faces the difficult prospect of having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt payments while simultaneously attacking a serious and growing crime problem that is hampering economic growth.,2495000,2006,6 August 1962 (from the UK),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,2.6,2001 census,$ -2 893 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,0.9,NA,$ 6 609 000 000,31 December 2007,,,573520.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 6 August (1962),20,2008,0.0,NA,hurricanes (especially July to November),slightly smaller than Connecticut,87.9,2003 est.,73.53,2009 est.,bicameral Parliament consists of the Senate (a 21-member body appointed by the governor general on the recommendations of the prime minister and the leader of the opposition; ruling party is allocated 13 seats and the opposition is allocated 8 seats) and the House of Representatives (60 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: last held 3 September 2007 (next to be held no later than October 2012) election results: percent of vote by party - JLP 50.1% PNP 49.8%; seats by party - JLP 33 PNP 27,based on English common law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP C Caricom CDB FAO G-15 G-77 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt (signatory) ICRM IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM ISO ITSO ITU LAES MIGA NAM OAS OPANAL OPCW UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,688480.0,2008 est.,0.6,2006 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,heavy rates of deforestation; coastal waters polluted by industrial waste sewage and oil spills; damage to coral reefs; air pollution in Kingston results from vehicle emissions,15.0,2008,2.0,2008,7040000000,2006 est.,,,Kingston Port Esquivel Port Kaiser Port Rhoades Rocky Point,18.0,NA,-0.5,2008 est.,mostly mountains with narrow discontinuous coastal plain,general assessment: fully automatic domestic telephone network domestic: the 1999 agreement to open the market for telecommunications services resulted in rapid growth in mobile-cellular telephone usage while the number of fixed-lines in use has declined; combined mobile-cellular teledensity now exceeds 100 per 100 persons international: country code - 1-876; the Fibralink submarine cable network provides enhanced delivery of business and broadband traffic and is linked to the Americas Region Caribbean Ring System (ARCOS-1) submarine cable in the Dominican Republic; the link to ARCOS-1 provides seamless connectivity to US parts of the Caribbean Central America and South America; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2006),2.25,2009 est.,11.0,2008 est.,constitutional parliamentary democracy and a Commonwealth realm,diagonal yellow cross divides the flag into four triangles - green (top and bottom) and black (hoist side and outer side); green represents hope vegetation and agriculture black reflects hardships overcome and to be faced and yellow recalls golden sunshine and the island's natural resources,transshipment point for cocaine from South America to North America and Europe; illicit cultivation and consumption of cannabis; government has an active manual cannabis eradication program; corruption is a major concern; substantial money-laundering activity; Colombian narcotics traffickers favor Jamaica for illicit financial transactions,$ 7 185 000 000,2008 est.,21552,2005,0.76,2009 est.,-0.6,2008 est.,,,$ 20 880 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Brenda LaGrange JOHNSON embassy: 142 Old Hope Road Kingston 6 mailing address: P.O.

As a result of its dwindling oil resources Oman is actively pursuing a development plan that focuses on diversification industrialization and privatization with the objective of reducing the oil sector's contribution to GDP to 9% by 2020. Some of these projects may be in jeopardy however because Muscat overestimated its ability to produce or secure the natural gas needed to power them. Oman actively seeks private foreign investors especially in the industrial information technology tourism and higher education fields. Industrial development plans focus on gas resources metal manufacturing petrochemicals and international transshipment ports. The drop in oil prices and the global financial crisis in 2008 will affect Oman's fiscal position and it may post a deficit in 2009 if oil prices stay low.

The recent president of Gabon El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba -one of the longest-serving heads of state in the world - had dominated the country's political scene for four decades. President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system and a new constitution in the early 1990s. However allegations of electoral fraud during local elections in 2002-03 and the presidential elections in 2005 exposed the weaknesses of formal political structures in Gabon. President BONGO died in June 2009 and was replaced in accordance with the constitution by Rose Francine ROGOMBE the president of the Senate. New elections are planned for the summer of 2009. This will be the first Gabonese elections in which BONGO is not participating.

Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts for more than 50% of GDP. Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil timber and manganese exports. Despite the abundance of natural wealth poor fiscal management hobbles the economy. In 1997 an IMF mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items overborrowing from the central bank and slipping on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices since 1999 have helped growth but drops in production have hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains and will continue to temper the gains for most of this decade. In December 2000 Gabon signed a new agreement with the Paris Club to reschedule its official debt. A follow-up bilateral repayment agreement with the US was signed in December 2001. Gabon signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2007 and received Paris Club debt rescheduling later that year.,1169000,2007,17 August 1960 (from France),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,100000000,2006 est.,,,$ 2 727 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,2.1,NA,$ 359 800 000,31 December 2007,,,190519.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 17 August (1960),2,2008,0.0,NA,NA,slightly smaller than Colorado,63.2,1995 est.,53.11,2009 est.,bicameral legislature consists of the Senate (102 seats; members elected by members of municipal councils and departmental assemblies to serve six-year terms) and the National Assembly or Assemblee Nationale (120 seats; members are elected by direct popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: Senate - last held 18 January 2009 (next to be held in January 2015); National Assembly - last held 17 and 24 December 2006 (next to be held in December 2011) election results: Senate - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PDG 75 GPR 6 UGDD 3 CLR 2 PGCI 2 UPG 2 ADERE 1 independents 9; National Assembly - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PDG 82 RPG 8 UPG 8 UGDD 4 ADERE 3 CLR 2 PGP-Ndaot 2 PSD 2 independents 4 others 5,based on French civil law system and customary law; judicial review of legislative acts in Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACCT ACP AfDB AU BDEAC CEMAC FAO FZ G-24 G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MINURCAT NAM OIC OIF OPCW UN UNAMID UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNMIS UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,331181.0,2008 est.,3.4,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,deforestation; poaching,5.0,2008,1.0,2008,1671000000,2006 est.,814,2008,Gamba Libreville Lucinda Port-Gentil,21.0,NA,1.0,2008 est.,narrow coastal plain; hilly interior; savanna in east and south,general assessment: adequate service by African standards and improving with the help of a growing mobile cell network system with multiple providers; mobile-cellular subscribership reached 80 per 100 persons in 2007 domestic: adequate system of cable microwave radio relay tropospheric scatter radiotelephone communication stations and a domestic satellite system with 12 earth stations international: country code - 241; landing point for the SAT-3/WASC fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to Europe and Asia; satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2007),4.65,2009 est.,21.0,2006 est.,republic; multiparty presidential regime,three equal horizontal bands of green (top) yellow and blue,,$ 2 577 000 000,2008 est.,9170,2004,1.93,2009 est.,3.6,2008 est.,,,$ 21 440 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Eunice S.

Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several sham elections as well as through the use of brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and Burundi led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by a second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola Chad Namibia Sudan and Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA's regime. A cease-fire was signed in July 1999 by the DRC Congolese armed rebel groups Angola Namibia Rwanda Uganda and Zimbabwe but sporadic fighting continued. Laurent KABILA was assassinated in January 2001 and his son Joseph KABILA was named head of state. In October 2002 the new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying eastern Congo; two months later the Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a government of national unity. A transitional government was set up in July 2003. Joseph KABILA as president and four vice presidents represented the former government former rebel groups the political opposition and civil society. The transitional government held a successful constitutional referendum in December 2005 and elections for the presidency National Assembly and provincial legislatures in 2006. KABILA was inaugurated president in December 2006. The National Assembly was installed in September 2006. Its president Vital KAMERHE was chosen in December.

Conflict that began in August 1998 has dramatically reduced national output and government revenue increased external debt and resulted in the deaths of more than 5 million people from violence famine and disease. Foreign businesses curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict lack of infrastructure and the difficult operating environment. Conditions began to improve in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. The transitional government reopened relations with international financial institutions and international donors and President KABILA began implementing reforms although progress has been slow and the International Monetary Fund curtailed their program for the DRC at the end of March 2006 because of fiscal overruns. Much economic activity still occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in GDP data. Renewed activity in the mining sector the source of most export income boosted Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP growth from 2006-2008 however renewed strife in the second half of 2008 combined with a fall in world market prices for the DRC's key mineral exports inflicted major damage on the economy and halted growth.

In that same year the British began the first organized colonial settlement. A series of land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native peoples.

This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector. Per capita income has risen for nine consecutive years and reached $27 900 in 2008 in purchasing power parity terms. Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the decade helping fuel a large balance of payments deficit that posed a challenge for economic managers. Inflationary pressures caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January 2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007-08; international capital inflows attracted to the high rates further strengthened the currency and housing market however aggravating the current account deficit.

Three years later the southern government adopted a Marxist orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the south to the north contributed to two decades of hostility between the states. The two countries were formally unified as the Republic of Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement in 1994 was quickly subdued.

In 1950 the French Foreign Minister Robert SCHUMAN proposed an eventual union of all Europe the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of Western Europe. The following year the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up when six members Belgium France West Germany Italy Luxembourg and the Netherlands signed the Treaty of Paris. The ECSC was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other parts of the countries' economies. In 1957 the Treaties of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and the six member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market. In 1967 the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the European Community (EC) creating a single Commission a single Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Members of the European Parliament were initially selected by national parliaments but in 1979 the first direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five years since. In 1973 the first enlargement of the EC took place with the addition of Denmark Ireland and the United Kingdom. The 1980s saw further membership expansion with Greece joining in 1981 and Spain and Portugal in 1986. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy in judicial and internal affairs and in the creation of an economic and monetary union - including a common currency. This further integration created the European Union (EU). In 1995 Austria Finland and Sweden joined the EU raising the membership total to 15. A new currency the euro was launched in world money markets on 1 January 1999; it became the unit of exchange for all of the EU states except the United Kingdom Sweden and Denmark. In 2002 citizens of the 12 euro-area countries began using the euro banknotes and coins. Ten new countries joined the EU in 2004 - Cyprus the Czech Republic Estonia Hungary Latvia Lithuania Malta Poland Slovakia and Slovenia - and in 2007 Bulgaria and Romania joined bringing the current membership to 27. In order to ensure that the EU can continue to function efficiently with an expanded membership the Treaty of Nice (in force as of 1 February 2003) set forth rules streamlining the size and procedures of EU institutions. An effort to establish an EU constitution begun in October 2004 failed to attain unanimous ratification. A new effort undertaken in June 2007 calls for the creation of an Intergovernmental Conference to form a political agreement known as the Reform Treaty which is to serve as a constitution. Unlike the constitution however the Reform Treaty would amend existing treaties rather than replace them. In June 2008 the Irish rejected the Reform Treaty in a referendum.,5.6,2007 est.,machinery motor vehicles aircraft plastics pharmaceuticals and other chemicals fuels iron and steel nonferrous metals wood pulp and paper products textiles meat dairy products fish alcoholic beverages.,8.03,31 December 2007,10.28,2009 est.,,,$ 18 850 000 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,,wheat barley oilseeds sugar beets wine grapes; dairy products cattle sheep pigs poultry; fish,,9.9,2009 est.,,,,,cold temperate; potentially subarctic in the north to temperate; mild wet winters; hot dry summers in the south,machinery vehicles aircraft plastics crude oil chemicals textiles metals foodstuffs clothing,Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left or GUE/NGL [Francis WURTZ]; European People's Party-European Democrats or EPP-ED [Joseph DAUL]; Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or ALDE [Graham R.

Because of the great differences in per capita income among member states (from $7 000 to $69 000) and historic national animosities the EU faces difficulties in devising and enforcing common policies. For example since 2003 Germany and France have flouted the member states' treaty obligation to prevent their national budgets from running more than a 3% deficit. Between 2004 and 2007 the EU admitted 12 countries that are in general less advanced technologically and economically than the other 15.

During the second millennium B.C. remnants of this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples. The area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the Persians Greeks Scythians Arabs (who brought Islam) Afghans and Turks. The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries; the British came to dominate the region in the 18th century. The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved and India and Pakistan fought two wars - in 1947-48 and 1965 - over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India capitalized on Islamabad's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing Pakistan conducted its own tests in 1998. The dispute over the state of Kashmir is ongoing but discussions and confidence-building measures have led to decreased tensions since 2002. Mounting public dissatisfaction with President MUSHARRAF coupled with the assassination of the prominent and popular political leader Benazir BHUTTO in late 2007 and MUSHARRAF's resignation in August 2008 led to the September presidential election of Asif ZARDARI BHUTTO's widower. Pakistani government and military leaders are struggling to control Islamist militants many of whom are located in the tribal areas adjacent to the border with Afghanistan. The November 2008 Mumbai attacks again inflamed Indo-Pakistan relations.

Communist partisans took over the country in 1944. Albania allied itself first with the USSR (until 1960) and then with China (to 1978). In the early 1990s Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic Communist rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment widespread corruption a dilapidated physical infrastructure powerful organized crime networks and combative political opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development since first holding multiparty elections in 1991 but deficiencies remain. International observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997; however there have been claims of electoral fraud in every one of Albania's post-communist elections. In the 2005 general elections the Democratic Party and its allies won a decisive victory on pledges to reduce crime and corruption promote economic growth and decrease the size of government. The election and particularly the orderly transition of power was considered an important step forward. Albania joined NATO in April 2009 and is a potential candidate for EU accession. Although Albania's economy continues to grow the country is still one of the poorest in Europe hampered by a large informal economy and an inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure.,15.0,September 2006 est.,textiles and footwear; asphalt metals and metallic ores crude oil; vegetables fruits tobacco,14.1,31 December 2007,5.55,July 2009 est.,207.0,2008,$ 13 520 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,12 counties (qarqe singular - qark); Berat Diber Durres Elbasan Fier Gjirokaster Korce Kukes Lezhe Shkoder Tirane Vlore,41.7,2001,1.71,2000,wheat corn potatoes vegetables fruits sugar beets grapes; meat dairy products,Joint Force Command (includes Land Naval and Aviation Brigade Commands) Joint Support Command (includes Logistic Command) Training and Doctrine Command (2009),15.29,2009 est.,2.9,2002,$ 3 458 000 000,2008 est.,mild temperate; cool cloudy wet winters; hot clear dry summers; interior is cooler and wetter,machinery and equipment foodstuffs textiles chemicals,Agrarian Environmentalist Party or PAA [Lufter XHUVELI]; Christian Democratic Party or PDK [Nard NDOKA]; Communist Party of Albania or PKSH [Hysni MILLOSHI]; Democratic Alliance Party or AD [Neritan CEKA]; Democratic Party or PD [Sali BERISHA]; G99 Political Movement [Erion VELIAJ]; Liberal Union Party or BLD [Arjan STAROVA]; National Front Party (Balli Kombetar) or PBK [Artur ROSHI]; New Democratic Party or PDR [Genc POLLO]; Republican Party or PR [Fatmir MEDIU]; Social Democracy Party of Albania or PDSSh [Paskal MILO]; Social Democratic Party or PSD [Skender GJINUSHI]; Socialist Movement for Integration or LSI [Ilir META]; Socialist Party or PS [Edi RAMA]; Socialist Party 1991 [Petro KOCI]; Union for Human Rights Party or PBDNj [Vangjel DULE],3639453,July 2009 est.,noun: Albanian(s) adjective: Albanian,petroleum natural gas coal bauxite chromite copper iron ore nickel salt timber hydropower,-4.28,2009 est.,strategic location along Strait of Otranto (links Adriatic Sea to Ionian Sea and Mediterranean Sea),Citizens Advocacy Office [Kreshnik SPAHIU]; Confederation of Trade Unions of Albania or KSSH [Kastriot MUCO]; Front for Albanian National Unification or FBKSH [Gafur ADILI]; Mjaft Movement; Omonia [Jani JANI]; Union of Independent Trade Unions of Albania or BSPSH [Gezim KALAJA],Lagging behind its Balkan neighbors Albania is making the difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy. Macroeconomic growth has averaged around 5% over the last five years and inflation is low and stable. The government has taken measures to curb violent crime and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large gray economy and attracting foreign investment. The economy is bolstered by annual remittances from abroad representing about 15% of GDP mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy; this helps offset the towering trade deficit. The agricultural sector which accounts for over half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment unclear property rights and the prevalence of small inefficient plots of land. Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new foreign investment. The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has helped diversify generation capacity and plans to upgrade transmission lines between Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy shortages. Also with help from EU funds the government is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth.,2300000,2007,28 November 1912 (from the Ottoman Empire),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,30000000,2006 est.,10.0,NA,$ -1 906 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,2800000000.0,2007 est.,1.9,NA,$ 7 247 000 000,31 December 2007,2004,,768536.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 28 November (1912),24,2008,0.0,NA,destructive earthquakes; tsunamis occur along southwestern coast; floods; drought,slightly smaller than Maryland,98.7,2001 census,77.96,2009 est.,unicameral Assembly or Kuvendi (140 seats; 100 members elected by direct popular vote and 40 by proportional vote to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 3 July 2005 (next to be held in 2009) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PD 56 PS 42 PR 11 PSD 7 LSI 5 other 19 note: Parliament in November 2008 approved an electoral reform package that will transform the electoral system from a majority system to a regional proportional system; the code will also establish an electoral threshold limiting smaller party representation,has a civil law system; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction; has accepted jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court for its citizens,BSEC CE CEI EAPC EBRD FAO IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO (correspondent) ITU ITUC MIGA NATO OIC OIF OPCW OSCE SECI UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNOMIG UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,908527.0,2008 est.,1.49,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,deforestation; soil erosion; water pollution from industrial and domestic effluents,1.0,2008,3.0,2008,2892000000,2007 est.,896,2008,Durres Sarande Shengjin Vlore,18.0,NA,3.0,2008 est.,mostly mountains and hills; small plains along coast,general assessment: despite new investment in fixed lines the density of main lines remains low with roughly 10 lines per 100 people; cellular telephone use is widespread and generally effective; combined fixed line and mobile telephone density is approximately 75 telephones per 100 persons domestic: offsetting the shortage of fixed line capacity mobile phone service has been available since 1996; by 2003 two companies were providing mobile services at a greater density than some of Albania's neighbors; Internet broadband services initiated in 2005; Internet cafes are popular in Tirana and have started to spread outside the capital international: country code - 355; submarine cable provides connectivity to Italy Croatia and Greece; the Trans-Balkan Line a combination submarine cable and land fiber-optic system provides additional connectivity to Bulgaria Macedonia and Turkey; international traffic carried by fiber-optic cable and when necessary by microwave radio relay from the Tirana exchange to Italy and Greece (2007),2.01,2009 est.,12.5,2008 est.,emerging democracy,red with a black two-headed eagle in the center; the design is claimed to be that of 15th-century hero George Castriota SKANDERBERG who led a successful uprising against the Turks that resulted in a short-lived independence for some Albanian regions (1443-1478),increasingly active transshipment point for Southwest Asian opiates hashish and cannabis transiting the Balkan route and - to a lesser extent - cocaine from South America destined for Western Europe; limited opium and expanding cannabis production; ethnic Albanian narcotrafficking organizations active and expanding in Europe; vulnerable to money laundering associated with regional trafficking in narcotics arms contraband and illegal aliens,$ 4 898 000 000,2008 est.,18000,2002,0.55,2009 est.,6.1,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 21 820 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador John L.

Under a series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September 1999 Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security and civilian responsibility for Palestinian-populated areas of the West Bank and Gaza. Negotiations to determine the permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza stalled following the outbreak of an intifada in September 2000 as Israeli forces reoccupied most Palestinian-controlled areas. In April 2003 the Quartet (US EU UN and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states Israel and a democratic Palestine. The proposed date for a permanent status agreement was postponed indefinitely due to violence and accusations that both sides had not followed through on their commitments. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late 2004 Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month later Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005 Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank settlements. Nonetheless Israel controls maritime airspace and most access to the Gaza Strip. A November 2005 PA-Israeli agreement authorized the reopening of the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt under joint PA and Egyptian control. In January 2006 the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS won control of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). The international community refused to accept the HAMAS-led government because it did not recognize Israel would not renounce violence and refused to honor previous peace agreements between Israel and the PA. HAMAS took control of the PA government in March 2006 but President ABBAS had little success negotiating with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the international community so as to lift economic sanctions on Palestinians. The PLC was unable to convene throughout most of 2006 as a result of Israel's detention of many HAMAS PLC members and Israeli-imposed travel restrictions on other PLC members. Violent clashes took place between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulting in numerous Palestinian deaths and injuries. ABBAS and HAMAS Political Bureau Chief MISHAL in February 2007 signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA. However fighting continued in the Gaza Strip and in June 2007 HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the NUG's dismissal and has called for resuming talks with Fatah but ABBAS has ruled out negotiations until HAMAS agrees to a return of PA control over the Gaza Strip and recognizes the FAYYAD-led government. FAYYAD and his PA government initiated a series of security and economic reforms to improve conditions in the West Bank. ABBAS participated in talks with Israel's Prime Minister OLMERT and secured the release of some Palestinian prisoners and previously withheld customs revenue. During a November 2007 international meeting in Annapolis Maryland ABBAS and OLMERT agreed to resume peace negotiations with the goal of reaching a final peace settlement.,15.0,June 2008,olives fruit vegetables limestone,7.73,31 December 2006,3.66,July 2009 est.,,,$ 6 641 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,,olives citrus vegetables; beef dairy products,,25.44,2009 est.,,,$ 1 149 000 000,2006,temperate; temperature and precipitation vary with altitude warm to hot summers cool to mild winters,food consumer goods construction materials,,2461267,July 2009 est.,noun: NA adjective: NA,arable land,0.0,2009 est.,landlocked; highlands are main recharge area for Israel's coastal aquifers; there are about 340 Israeli civilian sites - including 100 small outpost communities in the West Bank and 29 sites in East Jerusalem (July 2008 est.),,The West Bank - the larger of the two areas comprising the Palestinian Authority (PA) - has experienced a general decline in economic conditions since the second intifada began in September 2000. The downturn has been largely a result of Israeli closure policies - the imposition of closures and access restrictions in response to security concerns in Israel - which disrupted labor and trading relationships. In 2001 and even more severely in 2002 Israeli military measures in PA areas resulted in the destruction of capital the disruption of administrative structures and widespread business closures. International aid of at least $1.14 billion to the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2004 prevented the complete collapse of the economy and allowed some reforms in the government's financial operations. In 2005 high unemployment and limited trade opportunities - due to continued closures both within the West Bank and externally - stymied growth. Israel's and the international community's financial embargo of the PA when HAMAS ran the PA during March 2006 - June 2007 interrupted the provision of PA social services and the payment of PA salaries. Since then the FAYYAD government in the West Bank has restarted salary payments and the provision of services but would be unable to operate absent high levels of international assistance.,1026000,2007,,,,,,,,8.0,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.3,NA,$ 368 200 000,31 December 2007,,,515102.0,2009 est.,,,,-408.0,NA,droughts,slightly smaller than Delaware,92.4,2004 est.,74.54,2009 est.,,,,,,,,,,,adequacy of fresh water supply; sewage treatment,,,1.0,2008,,,,,,,,2.4,2005,mostly rugged dissected upland some vegetation in west but barren in east,general assessment: NA domestic: Israeli company BEZEK and the Palestinian company PALTEL are responsible for fixed line services; the Palestinian JAWAL company provides cellular services international: country code - 970 (2004),3.22,2009 est.,16.3,2008 est.,,,,$ 1 300 000 000,2006,5147,2006,2.18,2009 est.,0.8,2008 est.,,,$ 11 950 000 000,2008 est.,,$ 2 900,2008 est.,,

After opening up its locally-controlled casino industry to foreign competition in 2001 the territory attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment transforming Macao into the world's largest gaming center. By 2006 Macau's gaming revenue surpassed that of the Las Vegas strip and gaming-related taxes accounted for 75% of total government revenue. In 2008 government revenue from gaming was set to double 2006 collections. The expanding casino sector and China's decision beginning in 2002 to relax travel restrictions reenergized Macau's tourism industry. This city of just over 500 000 hosted more than 30 million visitors in 2008. Almost 60% of these came from mainland China despite increasing restrictions on travel to the SAR. Macau's traditional manufacturing industry has been in a slow decline since the termination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. In 2008 exports of textiles and garments generated only $1.1 billion compared to $13.7 billion in gross gaming receipts.

Successful efforts at economic diversification have reduced the portion of GDP based on oil and gas output to 25%. Since the discovery of oil in the UAE more than 30 years ago the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. The government has increased spending on job creation and infrastructure expansion and is opening up utilities to greater private sector involvement. In April 2004 the UAE signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with Washington and in November 2004 agreed to undertake negotiations toward a Free Trade Agreement with the US. The country's Free Trade Zones - offering 100% foreign ownership and zero taxes - are helping to attract foreign investors. Higher oil revenue strong liquidity housing shortages and cheap credit in 2005-07 led to a surge in asset prices (shares and real estate) and consumer inflation. The global financial crisis and the resulting tight international credit market and falling oil prices have already begun to deflate asset prices and will result in slower economic growth for 2009. Dependence on oil and a large expatriate workforce are significant long-term challenges. The UAE's strategic plan for the next few years focuses on diversification and creating more opportunities for nationals through improved education and increased private sector employment.,7595000,2007,2 December 1971 (from the UK),6848000000,2005 est.,1343000000,2005,43110000000,2006 est.,4.0,NA,$ 34 300 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,2.9,NA,$ 155 400 000 000,31 December 2007,,,788632.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 2 December (1971),58,2008,0.0,NA,frequent sand and dust storms,slightly smaller than Maine,77.9,2003 est.,76.11,2009 est.,unicameral Federal National Council (FNC) or Majlis al-Ittihad al-Watani (40 seats; 20 members appointed by the rulers of the constituent states 20 members elected to serve two-year terms) elections: elections for one half of the FNC (the other half remains appointed) held in the UAE on 18-20 December 2006; the new electoral college - a body of 6 689 Emiratis (including 1 189 women) appointed by the rulers of the seven emirates - were the only eligible voters and candidates; 456 candidates including 65 women ran for 20 contested FNC seats; one female from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi won a seat and 8 women were among the 20 appointed members note: reviews legislation but cannot change or veto,based on a dual system of Sharia and civil courts; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ABEDA AFESD AMF FAO G-77 GCC IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IPU ISO ITSO ITU LAS MIGA NAM OAPEC OIC OPCW OPEC UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,884853.0,2008 est.,3.1,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection signed but not ratified: Law of the Sea,lack of natural freshwater resources compensated by desalination plants; desertification; beach pollution from oil spills,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,62760000000,2006 est.,,,Mina' Zayid (Abu Dhabi) Al Fujayrah Mina' Jabal 'Ali (Dubai) Mina' Rashid (Dubai) Mina' Saqr (Ra's al Khaymah) Khawr Fakkan (Sharjah),,,6.7,2008 est.,flat barren coastal plain merging into rolling sand dunes of vast desert wasteland; mountains in east,general assessment: modern fiber-optic integrated services; digital network with rapidly growing use of mobile-cellular telephones; key centers are Abu Dhabi and Dubai domestic: microwave radio relay fiber optic and coaxial cable international: country code - 971; linked to the international submarine cable FLAG (Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe); landing point for both the SEA-ME-WE-3 and SEA-ME-WE-4 submarine cable networks; satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (1 Atlantic Ocean and 2 Indian Ocean) and 1 Arabsat; tropospheric scatter to Bahrain; microwave radio relay to Saudi Arabia,2.42,2009 est.,2.4,2001,federation with specified powers delegated to the UAE federal government and other powers reserved to member emirates,three equal horizontal bands of green (top) white and black with a wider vertical red band on the hoist side,the UAE is a drug transshipment point for traffickers given its proximity to Southwest Asian drug-producing countries; the UAE's position as a major financial center makes it vulnerable to money laundering; anti-money-laundering controls improving but informal banking remains unregulated,$ 145 800 000 000,2008 est.,4080,2008,3.69,2009 est.,7.7,2008 est.,5.0,2007,$ 184 600 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Richard G.

The defeat of the Serbian empire at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of Ottoman rule during which large numbers of Turks and Albanians moved to Kosovo. By the end of the 19th century Albanians replaced the Serbs as the dominant ethnic group in Kosovo. Serbia reacquired control over Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire during the First Balkan War of 1912. Kosovo became an autonomous province of Serbia with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the 1974 Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Despite legislative concessions Albanian nationalism increased in the 1980s which led to riots and calls for Kosovo's independence. At the same time Serb nationalist leaders such as Slobodan MILOSEVIC exploited Kosovo Serb claims of maltreatment to secure votes from supporters many of whom viewed Kosovo as their cultural heartland. Under MILOSEVIC's leadership Serbia instituted a new constitution in 1989 that revoked Kosovo's status as an autonomous province of Serbia. Kosovo Albanian leaders responded in 1991 by organizing a referendum that declared Kosovo independent. Under MILOSEVIC Serbia carried out repressive measures against the Albanians in the early 1990s as the unofficial Kosovo government led by Ibrahim RUGOVA used passive resistance in an attempt to try to gain international assistance and recognition of an independent Kosovo. Albanians dissatisfied with RUGOVA's passive strategy in the 1990s created the Kosovo Liberation Army and launched an insurgency. Starting in 1998 Serbian military police and paramilitary forces conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians. International attempts to mediate the conflict failed and MILOSEVIC's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month NATO bombing campaign against Serbia beginning in March 1999 that forced Serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from Kosovo. UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) placed Kosovo under a transitional administration the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. A UN-led process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's final status. The negotiations ran in stages between 2006 and 2007 but ended without agreement between Belgrade and Pristina. On 17 February 2008 the Kosovo Assembly declared Kosovo independent. Since then over fifty countries have recognized Kosovo. Serbia continues to reject Kosovo's independence and subsequently has sought an advisory opinion with the backing of the General Assembly from the International Court of Justice on the legality under international law of Kosovo's independence declaration.,16.5,2007 est.,mining and processed metal products scrap metals leather products machinery appliances,,,,,,,$ 3 237 000 000,2007 est.,,,,,30 municipalities (komunat singular - komuna in Albanian; opstine singular - opstina in Serbian); Decan (Decani) Dragash (Dragas) Ferizaj (Urosevac) Fushe Kosove (Kosovo Polje) Gjakove (Dakovica) Gjilan (Gnjilane) Gllogovc/Drenas (Glogovac) Istog (Istok) Kacanik Kamenice/Dardana (Kamenica) Kline (Klina) Leposaviq (Leposavic) Lipjan (Lipljan) Malisheve (Malisevo) Mitrovice (Mitrovica) Novoberde (Novo Brdo) Obiliq (Obilic) Peje (Pec) Podujeve (Podujevo) Prishtine (Pristina) Prizren Rahovec (Orahovac) Shterpce (Strpce) Shtime (Stimlje) Skenderaj (Srbica) Suhareke (Suva Reka) Viti (Vitina) Vushtrri (Vucitrn) Zubin Potok Zvecan,,,,,wheat corn berries potatoes peppers,,,,,,$ 1 190 000 000,2007 est.,influenced by continental air masses resulting in relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall and hot dry summers and autumns; Mediterranean and alpine influences create regional variation; maximum rainfall between October and December,foodstuffs wood petroleum chemicals machinery and electrical equipment,Albanian Christian Democratic Party of Kosovo or PShDK [Tome MARKU]; Alliance for the Future of Kosovo or AAK [Ramush HARADINAJ]; Alliance for a New Kosovo or AKR [Behgjet PACOLLI]; Alliance of Independent Social Democrats of Kosovo and Metohija or SDSKIM [Slavisa PETKOVIC]; Autonomous Liberal Party of SLS [Slobodan PETROVIC]; Bosniak Vakat Coalition [Dzezair MURATI]; Citizens' Initiative of Gora or GIG [Murselj HALJILJI]; Council of Independent Social Democrats of Kosovo or SNSDKIM [Ljubisa ZIVIC]; Democratic Action Party or SDA [Numan BALIC]; Democratic Ashkali Party of Kosovo or PDAK; Democratic League of Dardania or LDD [Nexhat DACI]; Democratic League of Kosovo or LDK [Fatmir SEJDIU]; Democratic Party of Ashkali of Kosovo or PDAK [Sabit RAHMANI]; Democratic Party of Kosovo or PDK [Hashim THACI]; Democratic Party Vatan [Sadik IDRIZI]; Democratic Union of Ashkalis or BDA [Sabit RRAHMANI]; Justice Party or PD [Sylejman QERKEZI]; Kosovo Democratic Turkish Party of KDTP [Mahir YAGCILAR]; Liberal Party of Kosovo or PLK [Gjergi DEDAJ]; New Democratic Initiative of Kosovo or IRDK [Xhevdet NEZIRAJ]; New Democratic Party or ND [Branislav GRBIC]; New Kosovo Alliance or AKR [Behxhet PACOLLI]; Popular Movement of Kosovo or LPK [Emrush XHEMAJLI]; Reform Party Ora [Teuta SAHATCIA]; Serb National Party or SNS [Mihailo SCEPANOVIC]; Serbian Kosovo and Metohija Party or SKMS [Dragisa MIRIC]; Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija [Oliver IVANOVIC]; Social Democratic Party of Kosovo or PSDK [Agim CEKU]; United Roma Party of Kosovo or PREBK [Haxhi Zylfi MERXHA],1804838,July 2009 est.,noun: Kosovar (Albanian) Kosovac (Serbian) adjective: Kosovar (Albanian) Kosovski (Serbian) note: Kosovan a neutral term is sometimes also used as a noun or adjective,nickel lead zinc magnesium lignite kaolin chrome bauxite,,,,Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedom (human rights); Humanitarian Law Centre (human rights); Movement for Self-Determination; Serb National Council (SNV),Over the past few years Kosovo's economy has shown significant progress in transitioning to a market-based system and maintaining macroeconomic stability but it is still highly dependent on the international community and the diaspora for financial and technical assistance. Remittances from the diaspora - located mainly in Germany and Switzerland - are estimated to account for about 15% of GDP and donor-financed activities and aid for another 15%. Kosovo's citizens are the poorest in Europe with an average annual per capita income of only $2 300. Unemployment around 40% of the population is a significant problem that encourages outward migration and black market activity. Most of Kosovo's population lives in rural towns outside of the capital Pristina. Inefficient near-subsistence farming is common - the result of small plots limited mechanization and lack of technical expertise. With international assistance Kosovo has been able to privatize 50% of its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by number and over 90% of SOEs by value. Minerals and metals - including lignite lead zinc nickel chrome aluminum magnesium and a wide variety of construction materials - once formed the backbone of industry but output has declined because of ageing equipment and insufficient investment. A limited and unreliable electricity supply due to technical and financial problems is a major impediment to economic development. Kosovo's Ministry of Energy and Mining has solicited expressions of interest from private investors to develop a new power plant in order to address Kosovo and the region's unmet and growing demands for power. The official currency of Kosovo is the euro but the Serbian dinar is also used in Serb enclaves. Kosovo's tie to the euro has helped keep core inflation low. Kosovo has one of the most open economies in the region and continues to work with the international community on measures to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment.,562000,2006,17 February 2008 (from Serbia),,,,,0,2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,388848.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 17 February (2008),,,297.0,NA,,slightly larger than Delaware,91.9,2007 Census,,,unicameral national Assembly (120 seats; 100 seats directly elected 10 seats guaranteed for ethnic Serbs 10 seats guaranteed for other ethnic minorities; to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 17 November 2007 (next to be held in 2011) election results: percent of vote by party - PDK 34.3% LDK 22.6% AKR 12.3% LDD 10.0% AAK 9.6% other 11.2%; seats by party - PDK 37 LDK 25 AKR 13 LDD 11 AAK 10 other 4,evolving legal system based on terms of UN Special Envoy Martti AHTISAARI's Plan for Kosovo's supervised independence,ITUC WFTU,,,,,,,,,4.0,2008,1.0,2008,832000000,2006,430,2007,,18.0,NA,,,flat fluvial basin with an elevation of 400-700 m above sea level surrounded by several high mountain ranges with elevations of 2 000 to 2 500 m,,,,40.0,2007 est.,republic,centered on a dark blue field is the geographical shape of Kosovo in a gold color surmounted by six white five-pointed stars - each representing one of the major ethnic groups of Kosovo - arrayed in a slight arc,,,,1924,2006,,,5.1,2007 est.,2.0,2008,$ 5 000 000 000,2007 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Tina KAIDANOW embassy: Arberia/Dragodan Nazim Hikmet 30 Pristina Kosovo mailing address: use embassy street address telephone: [381] 38 59 59 3000 FAX: [381] 38 549 890,$ 2 300,2007 est.,0,2007

their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science art and culture. Arab incursions starting in the 8th century and Turkic in the 12th were followed by those of European traders beginning in the late 15th century. By the 19th century Britain had assumed political control of virtually all Indian lands. Indian armed forces in the British army played a vital role in both World Wars. Nonviolent resistance to British colonialism led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU brought independence in 1947. The subcontinent was divided into the secular state of India and the smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A third war between the two countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons testing in 1998 caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year.

Services are the major source of economic growth accounting for more than half of India's output with less than one third of its labor force. Slightly more than half of the work force is in agriculture leading the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government to articulate a rural economic development program that includes creating basic infrastructure to improve the lives of the rural poor and boost economic performance. The government has reduced controls on foreign trade and investment. Higher limits on foreign direct investment were permitted in a few key sectors such as telecommunications. However tariff spikes in sensitive categories including agriculture and incremental progress on economic reforms still hinder foreign access to India's vast and growing market. Privatization of government-owned industries remains stalled and continues to generate political debate; populist pressure from within the UPA government had restrained needed initiatives. The economy has posted an average growth rate of more than 7% in the decade since 1997 reducing poverty by about 10 percentage points. India achieved 9.6% GDP growth in 2006 9.0% in 2007 and 6.6% in 2008 significantly expanding manufactures through late 2008. India also is capitalizing on its large numbers of well-educated people skilled in the English language to become a major exporter of software services and software workers. Strong growth combined with easy consumer credit a real estate boom and fast-rising commodity prices fueled inflation concerns from mid-2006 to August 2008. Rising tax revenues from better tax administration and economic expansion helped New Delhi make progress in reducing its fiscal deficit for three straight years before skyrocketing global commodity prices more than doubled the cost of government energy and fertilizer subsidies. The ballooning subsidies amidst slowing growth brought the return of a large fiscal deficit in 2008.

Corruption is ubiquitous and the government has been accused of authoritarianism. Although the poverty rate has been reduced in recent years the promise of widespread wealth from development of Azerbaijan's energy sector remains largely unfulfilled.,12.1,2005,oil and gas 90% machinery cotton foodstuffs,19.13,31 December 2007,8.3,July 2009 est.,1.0,2008,$ 53 260 000 000,2008 est.,$ 7 844 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,$ 5 232 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,59 rayons (rayonlar; rayon - singular) 11 cities (saharlar; sahar - singular) 1 autonomous republic (muxtar respublika) rayons: Abseron Rayonu Agcabadi Rayonu Agdam Rayonu Agdas Rayonu Agstafa Rayonu Agsu Rayonu Astara Rayonu Balakan Rayonu Barda Rayonu Beylaqan Rayonu Bilasuvar Rayonu Cabrayil Rayonu Calilabad Rayonu Daskasan Rayonu Davaci Rayonu Fuzuli Rayonu Gadabay Rayonu Goranboy Rayonu Goycay Rayonu Haciqabul Rayonu Imisli Rayonu Ismayilli Rayonu Kalbacar Rayonu Kurdamir Rayonu Lacin Rayonu Lankaran Rayonu Lerik Rayonu Masalli Rayonu Neftcala Rayonu Oguz Rayonu Qabala Rayonu Qax Rayonu Qazax Rayonu Qobustan Rayonu Quba Rayonu Qubadli Rayonu Qusar Rayonu Saatli Rayonu Sabirabad Rayonu Saki Rayonu Salyan Rayonu Samaxi Rayonu Samkir Rayonu Samux Rayonu Siyazan Rayonu Susa Rayonu Tartar Rayonu Tovuz Rayonu Ucar Rayonu Xacmaz Rayonu Xanlar Rayonu Xizi Rayonu Xocali Rayonu Xocavand Rayonu Yardimli Rayonu Yevlax Rayonu Zangilan Rayonu Zaqatala Rayonu Zardab Rayonu cities: Ali Bayramli Sahari Baki Sahari Ganca Sahari Lankaran Sahari Mingacevir Sahari Naftalan Sahari Saki Sahari Sumqayit Sahari Susa Sahari Xankandi Sahari Yevlax Sahari autonomous republic: Naxcivan Muxtar Respublikasi,30.3,1997,17.25,2000,cotton grain rice grapes fruit vegetables tea tobacco; cattle pigs sheep goats,Army Navy Air and Air Defense Forces (2008),17.62,2009 est.,2.1,2006,$ 12 690 000 000,2008 est.,dry semiarid steppe,machinery and equipment oil products foodstuffs metals chemicals,"Azadliq (Freedom) coalition (Popular Front Party Liberal Party Citizens' Development Party); Azerbaijan Democratic Party or ADP [Sardar JALALOGLU]; Azerbaijan Democratic Reforms Party (ADRP) Youth Movement [Ramin HAJILI]; Azerbaijan Popular Front or APF now split in two [Ali KARIMLI leader of ""Reform"" APF party; Mirmahmud MIRALI-OGLU leader of ""Classic"" APF party]; Azerbaijan Public Forum [Eldar NAMAZOV]; Citizens' Development Party [Ali ALIYEV]; Civil Solidarity Party or CSP [Sabir RUSTAMKHANLY]; Dalga Youth Movement [Vafa JAFAROVA]; Green Party [Mais GULALIYEV and Tarana MAMMADOVA]; Hope (Umid) Party [Iqbal AGAZADE]; Ireli Youth Movement [Jeyhun OSMANLI Roya TALIBOVA Farhad MAMMADOV Elnara GARIBOVA Elnur MAMMADOV Ziya ALIYEV]; Justice Party [Ilyas ISMAILOV]; Liberal Party of Azerbaijan [Lala Shovkat HACIYEVA]; Magam Youth Movement [Emin HUSEYNOV]; Motherland Party [Fazail AGAMALI]; Musavat (Equality) [Isa GAMBAR chairman]; Musavat Party Youth Movement [Elnur MAMMADLI]; National Democratic Party or Grey Wolves (Nationalist Pan-Turkic) [Iskender HAMIDOV]; Open Society Party [Rasul GULIYEV in exile in the US]; Party for National Independence of Azerbaijan or PNIA [Ayaz RUSTAMOV]; Popular Front Party Youth Movement [Seymur KHAZIYEV]; Social Democratic Party of Azerbaijan or SDP [Araz ALIZADE and Ayaz MUTALIBOV (in exile)]; Turkish Nationalist Party [Vugar BAYTURAN]; United Azerbaijan Party [Karrar ABILOV]; United Azerbaijan National Unity Party [Hajibaba AZIMOV]; United Party [Tahir KARIMLI]; Yeni (New) Azerbaijan Party [President Ilham ALIYEV]; Yeni Azerbaijan Party Youth Movement [Ramil HASANOV]; Yox (No) Youth Movement [Ali ISMAYILOV] note: opposition parties regularly factionalize and form new parties;",8238672,July 2009 est.,noun: Azerbaijani(s) adjective: Azerbaijani,petroleum natural gas iron ore nonferrous metals bauxite,-1.69,2009 est.,both the main area of the country and the Naxcivan exclave are landlocked,Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (self-proclaimed); Karabakh Liberation Organization; Sadval Lezgin movement; Talysh independence movement; Union of Pro-Azerbaijani Forces or UPAF,Azerbaijan's high economic growth during 2006-08 is attributable to large and growing oil exports but the non-energy sector also featured double-digit growth in 2008 spurred by growth in the construction banking and real estate sectors. However the current global economic slowdown presents some challenges for the Azerbaijani economy as oil prices have plummeted since mid-2008 and local banks face a more uncertain international financial environment. Azerbaijan's oil production declined through 1997 but has registered an increase every year since. Negotiation of production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with foreign firms which have committed $60 billion to long-term oilfield development should generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development. Oil production under the first of these PSAs with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company began in November 1997. A consortium of Western oil companies built a $4 billion pipeline from Baku to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan which will pump 1.2 million barrels a day from a large offshore field when at full capacity. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the former Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy but its considerable energy resources brighten its medium-term prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic reform and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress: the need for stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region pervasive corruption and potential for a sharp downturn in the construction and real estate sectors. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices the location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region and Azerbaijan's ability to manage its energy wealth to promote sustainable growth in non-energy sectors of the economy and spur employment.,4300000,2007,30 August 1991 (from the Soviet Union),0,2007 est.,0,2005,9770000000,2007 est.,1.8,NA,$ 16 450 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,500000000.0,2007 est.,1.0,NA,$ 5 726 000 000,31 December 2007,,,1727464.0,2009 est.,Founding of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan 28 May (1918),89,2008,-28.0,NA,droughts,slightly smaller than Maine,98.8,1999 census,66.66,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly or Milli Mejlis (125 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: last held 6 November 2005 (next to be held in November 2010) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - Yeni 58 Azadliq coalition 8 CSP 2 Motherland 2 other parties with single seats 9 independents 42 undetermined 4,based on civil law system; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB BSEC CE CIS EAPC EBRD ECO FAO GCTU GUAM IAEA IBRD ICAO ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA NAM (observer) OAS (observer) OIC OPCW OSCE PFP SECI (observer) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO (observer),,,2278888.0,2008 est.,2.6,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,local scientists consider the Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) (including Baku and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated area in the world because of severe air soil and water pollution; soil pollution results from oil spills from the use of DDT pesticide and from toxic defoliants used in the production of cotton,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,23800000000,2007 est.,2122,2008,Baku (Baki),18.0,NA,6.0,2008 est.,large flat Kur-Araz Ovaligi (Kura-Araks Lowland) (much of it below sea level) with Great Caucasus Mountains to the north Qarabag Yaylasi (Karabakh Upland) in west; Baku lies on Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) that juts into Caspian Sea,general assessment: inadequate; requires considerable expansion and modernization; teledensity of 15 main lines per 100 persons is low; mobile-cellular penetration is increasing and is currently about 50 telephones per 100 persons domestic: fixed-line telephony and a broad range of other telecom services are controlled by a state-owned telecommunications monopoly and growth has been stagnant; more competition exists in the mobile-cellular market with three providers in 2006; satellite service connects Baku to a modern switch in its exclave of Naxcivan international: country code - 994; the Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) fiber-optic link transits Azerbaijan providing international connectivity to neighboring countries; the old Soviet system of cable and microwave is still serviceable; satellite earth stations - 2 (2007),2.04,2009 est.,0.8,2008 est.,republic,three equal horizontal bands of blue (top) red and green; a crescent and eight-pointed star in white are centered in red band,limited illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium poppy mostly for CIS consumption; small government eradication program; transit point for Southwest Asian opiates bound for Russia and to a lesser extent the rest of Europe,$ 7 575 000 000,2008 est.,59141,2004,0.76,2009 est.,11.6,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 73 650 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Anne E.

In 1998 violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Botswanan military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community.

However the government has recently strengthened its tax system to reduce dependency on customs duties. Completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 permitted the sale of water to South Africa and generated royalties for Lesotho. Lesotho produces about 90% of its own electrical power needs. As the number of mineworkers has declined steadily over the past several years a small manufacturing base has developed based on farm products that support the milling canning leather and jute industries as well as a rapidly expanding apparel-assembly sector. The latter has grown significantly mainly due to Lesotho qualifying for the trade benefits contained in the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. The economy is still primarily based on subsistence agriculture especially livestock although drought has decreased agricultural activity. The extreme inequality in the distribution of income remains a major drawback. Lesotho has signed an Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF.

Success of the economy hinges upon seasonal variations in agriculture tourism and construction activity as well as remittance inflows. Much of the workforce is employed in banana production and tourism but persistent high unemployment has prompted many to leave the islands. This lower-middle-income country is vulnerable to natural disasters - tropical storms wiped out substantial portions of crops in 1994 1995 and 2002. In 2007 the islands had more than 200 000 tourist arrivals mostly to the Grenadines. Saint Vincent is home to a small offshore banking sector and has moved to adopt international regulatory standards. The government's ability to invest in social programs and respond to external shocks is constrained by its high debt burden - 25% of current revenues are directed towards debt servicing.

The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997 which were marred by violence and fraud but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI running as the candidate of the multiethnic united opposition group the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform. KIBAKI's NARC coalition splintered in 2005 over the constitutional review process. Government defectors joined with KANU to form a new opposition coalition the Orange Democratic Movement which defeated the government's draft constitution in a popular referendum in November 2005. KIBAKI's reelection in December 2007 brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1 500 people died.

In 1997 the IMF suspended Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to the government's failure to maintain reforms and curb corruption. A severe drought from 1999 to 2000 compounded Kenya's problems causing water and energy rationing and reducing agricultural output. As a result GDP contracted by 0.2% in 2000. The IMF which had resumed loans in 2000 to help Kenya through the drought again halted lending in 2001 when the government failed to institute several anticorruption measures. Despite the return of strong rains in 2001 weak commodity prices endemic corruption and low investment limited Kenya's economic growth to 1.2%. Growth lagged at 1.1% in 2002 because of erratic rains low investor confidence meager donor support and political infighting up to the elections. In the key December 2002 elections Daniel Arap MOI's 24-year-old reign ended and a new opposition government took on the formidable economic problems facing the nation. After some early progress in rooting out corruption and encouraging donor support the KIBAKI government was rocked by high-level graft scandals in 2005 and 2006. In 2006 the World Bank and IMF delayed loans pending action by the government on corruption. The international financial institutions and donors have since resumed lending despite little action on the government's part to deal with corruption. Post-election violence in early 2008 coupled with the effects of the global financial crisis on remittance and exports reduced GDP growth to 2.2% in 2008 down from 7% the previous year.,11440000,2007,12 December 1963 (from the UK),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,2.0,NA,$ -2 745 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,22500000.0,2007 est.,4.0,NA,$ 10 670 000 000,31 December 2007,,,5662755.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 12 December (1963),1,2008,0.0,NA,recurring drought; flooding during rainy seasons,slightly more than twice the size of Nevada,85.1,2003 est.,57.86,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly or Bunge usually referred to as Parliament (224 seats; 210 members elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms 12 nominated members who are appointed by the president but selected by the parties in proportion to their parliamentary vote totals 2 ex-officio members) elections: last held 27 December 2007 (next to be held in December 2012) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - ODM 99 PNU 46 ODM-K 16 KANU 14 other 35; ex-officio 2; seats appointed by the president - ODM 6 PNU 3 ODM-K 2 KANU 1,based on Kenyan statutory law Kenyan and English common law tribal law and Islamic law; judicial review in High Court; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations; constitutional amendment of 1982 making Kenya a de jure one-party state repealed in 1991,ACP AfDB AU C COMESA EAC EADB FAO G-15 G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IGAD ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MINURSO MONUC NAM OPCW PCA UN UNAMID UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNMIL UNMIS UNOCI UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,8805736.0,2008 est.,2.8,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,water pollution from urban and industrial wastes; degradation of water quality from increased use of pesticides and fertilizers; water hyacinth infestation in Lake Victoria; deforestation; soil erosion; desertification; poaching,10.0,2008,1.0,2008,5223000000,2008 est.,2778,2008,Mombasa,18.0,NA,4.8,2008 est.,low plains rise to central highlands bisected by Great Rift Valley; fertile plateau in west,general assessment: inadequate; fixed-line telephone system is small and inefficient; trunks are primarily microwave radio relay; business data commonly transferred by a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) system domestic: no recent growth in fixed-line infrastructure and the sole provider Telkom Kenya is slated for privatization; multiple providers in the mobile-cellular segment of the market fostering a boom in mobile-cellular telephone usage international: country code - 254; satellite earth stations - 4 Intelsat,4.56,2009 est.,40.0,2008 est.,republic,three equal horizontal bands of black (top) red and green; the red band is edged in white; a large warrior's shield covering crossed spears is superimposed at the center,widespread harvesting of small plots of marijuana; transit country for South Asian heroin destined for Europe and North America; Indian methaqualone also transits on way to South Africa; significant potential for money-laundering activity given the country's status as a regional financial center; massive corruption and relatively high levels of narcotics-associated activities,$ 11 070 000 000,2008 est.,63574,2008,2.69,2009 est.,2.2,2008 est.,,,$ 61 830 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Michael RANNEBERGER embassy: US Embassy United Nations Avenue Nairobi; P.

In keeping with this policy LUKASHENKO reimposed administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and expanded the state's right to intervene in the management of private enterprises. Since 2005 the government has re-nationalized a number of private companies. In addition businesses have been subject to pressure by central and local governments e.g. arbitrary changes in regulations numerous rigorous inspections retroactive application of new business regulations and arrests of ""disruptive"" businessmen and factory owners. A wide range of redistributive policies has helped those at the bottom of the ladder; the Gini coefficient is among the lowest in the world. Because of these restrictive economic policies Belarus has had trouble attracting foreign investment. Nevertheless government statistics indicate GDP growth has been strong in recent years reaching more than 9% in 2008 despite the roadblocks of a tough centrally directed economy with a high rate of inflation. Belarus receives discounted oil and natural gas from Russia and much of Belarus' growth can be attributed to the re-export of Russian oil at market prices. Trade with Russia - by far its largest single trade partner - decreased in 2007-08 largely as a result of a change in the way the Value Added Tax (VAT) on trade was collected. Russia has introduced an export duty on oil shipped to Belarus which will increase gradually through 2009 and a requirement that Belarusian duties on re-exported Russian oil be shared with Russia - 80% was slated to go to Russia in 2008 and 85% in 2009. Russia also increased Belarusian natural gas prices from $47 per thousand cubic meters (tcm)in 2006 to $100 per tcm in 2007 and to $128 per tcm in 2008 and plans to increase prices gradually to world levels by 2011. Russia's recent policy of bringing energy prices for Belarus to world market levels may result in a slowdown in economic growth in Belarus over the next few years. Some policy measures including improving energy efficiency and diversifying exports have been introduced but external borrowing has been the main mechanism used to manage the growing pressures on the economy. Belarus felt the effects of the global financial crisis in late 2008 and reached agreement with Russia in November for a $2 billion stabilization loan and with the IMF for a $2.5 billion stand-by agreement in January 2009. In line with IMF conditionality Belarus devalued the ruble approximately 20% in January 2009 and has tightened some fiscal and monetary policies.

Bolshevik control of the area was fiercely contested and not fully reestablished until 1925. Much of present-day Sughd province was transferred from the Uzbek SSR to the newly formed Tajik SSR in 1929. Ethnic Uzbeks form a substantial minority in Sughd province. Tajikistan became independent in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union and experienced a civil war between regional factions from 1992-97. There have been no major security incidents in recent years although the country remains the poorest in the former Soviet sphere. Attention by the international community since the beginning of the NATO intervention in Afghanistan has brought increased economic development and security assistance which could create jobs and strengthen stability in the long term.

Because of a lack of employment opportunities in Tajikistan nearly half of the labor force works abroad primarily in Russia supporting families in Tajikistan through remittances. The exact number of labor migrants is unknown but estimated at around 1 million. Less than 7% of the land area is arable. Cotton is the most important crop but this sector is burdened with debt and obsolete infrastructure. Mineral resources include silver gold uranium and tungsten. Industry consists only of a large aluminum plant hydropower facilities and small obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing. The civil war (1992-97) severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in industrial and agricultural production. Tajikistan's economic situation remains fragile due to uneven implementation of structural reforms corruption weak governance widespread unemployment seasonal power shortages and the external debt burden. A debt restructuring agreement was reached with Russia in December 2002 including a $250 million write-off of Tajikistan's $300 million debt. Completion of the Sangtuda I hydropower dam - built with Russian investment - and the Sangtuda II and Rogun dams will add substantially to electricity output. If finished according to Tajik plans Rogun will be the world's tallest dam. Tajikistan has also received substantial infrastructure development loans from the Chinese government to improve roads and an electricity transmission network. To help increase north-south trade the US funded a $36 million bridge which opened in August 2007 and links Tajikistan and Afghanistan. While Tajikistan has experienced steady economic growth since 1997 nearly two-thirds of the population continues to live in poverty. Economic growth reached 10.6% in 2004 but dropped to below 8% in 2005-08 as the effects of higher oil prices and then the international financial crisis began to register - mainly in the form of lower prices for key commodities and lower remittances from Tajiks working in Russia due to the declining economic conditions in that country.,3500000,2007,9 September 1991 (from the Soviet Union),0,2008,512700000,2008,542700000,2008,5.0,2003 est.,$ -783 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,3000000000.0,2008 est.,1.6,NA,,,,,1428218.0,2009 est.,Independence Day (or National Day) 9 September (1991),,,300.0,NA,earthquakes; floods,slightly smaller than Wisconsin,99.5,2000 census,65.33,2009 est.,bicameral Supreme Assembly or Majlisi Oli consists of the National Assembly (upper chamber) or Majlisi Milliy (34 seats; 25 members selected by local deputies 8 appointed by the president; 1 seat reserved for the former president; to serve five-year terms) and the Assembly of Representatives (lower chamber) or Majlisi Namoyandagon (63 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: National Assembly - last held 25 March 2005 (next to be held in February 2010); Assembly of Representatives 27 February and 13 March 2005 (next to be held in February 2010) election results: National Assembly - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PDPT 29 CPT 2 independents 3; Assembly of Representatives - percent of vote by party - PDPT 74.9% CPT 13.6% Islamic Revival Party 8.9% other 2.5%; seats by party - PDPT 51 CPT 5 Islamic Revival Party 2 independents 5,based on civil law system; no judicial review of legislative acts; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB CIS CSTO EAEC EAPC EBRD ECO FAO GCTU IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU MIGA OIC OPCW OSCE PFP SCO UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO (observer),,,1897356.0,2008 est.,3.9,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Environmental Modification Ozone Layer Protection Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,inadequate sanitation facilities; increasing levels of soil salinity; industrial pollution; excessive pesticides,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,14800000000,2008,680,2008,,18.0,NA,-4.0,2008 est.,Pamir and Alay Mountains dominate landscape; western Fergana Valley in north Kofarnihon and Vakhsh Valleys in southwest,general assessment: foreign investment in the telephone system has resulted in major improvements domestic: the domestic telecommunications network has historically been under funded and poorly maintained; main line availability has not changed significantly since 1998; mobile cellular use aided by competition among multiple operators has expanded rapidly; coverage now extends to all major cities and towns international: country code - 992; linked by cable and microwave radio relay to other CIS republics and by leased connections to the Moscow international gateway switch; Dushanbe linked by Intelsat to international gateway switch in Ankara (Turkey); satellite earth stations - 3 (2 Intelsat and 1 Orbita) (2008),2.99,2009 est.,2.3,2008 est.,republic,three horizontal stripes of red (top) a wider stripe of white and green; a gold crown surmounted by seven gold five-pointed stars is located in the center of the white stripe,major transit country for Afghan narcotics bound for Russian and to a lesser extent Western European markets; limited illicit cultivation of opium poppy for domestic consumption; Tajikistan seizes roughly 80% of all drugs captured in Central Asia and stands third worldwide in seizures of opiates (heroin and raw opium); significant consumer of opiates,$ 4 122 000 000,2008 est.,27767,2000,1.88,2009 est.,7.9,2008 est.,,,$ 15 400 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Tracey Ann JACOBSON embassy: 109-A Ismoili Somoni Avenue Dushanbe 734019 mailing address: 7090 Dushanbe Place Dulles VA 20189 telephone: [992] (37) 229-20-00 FAX: [992] (37) 229-20-50,$ 2 100,2008 est.,16000000,2008

Under his authoritarian leadership the country adopted wide-ranging social legal and political reforms. After a period of one-party rule an experiment with multi-party politics led to the 1950 election victory of the opposition Democratic Party and the peaceful transfer of power. Since then Turkish political parties have multiplied but democracy has been fractured by periods of instability and intermittent military coups (1960 1971 1980) which in each case eventually resulted in a return of political power to civilians. In 1997 the military again helped engineer the ouster - popularly dubbed a ""post-modern coup"" - of the then Islamic-oriented government. Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the island and has since acted as patron state to the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus "" which only Turkey recognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984 by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - now known as the People's Congress of Kurdistan or Kongra-Gel (KGK) - has dominated the Turkish military's attention and claimed more than 30 000 lives. After the capture of the group's leader in 1999 the insurgents largely withdrew from Turkey mainly to northern Iraq. In 2004 KGK announced an end to its ceasefire and attacks attributed to the KGK increased. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and in 1952 it became a member of NATO; it holds a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council from 2009-10. In 1964 Turkey became an associate member of the European Community.

Rifat HISARCIKLIOGLU],Turkey's dynamic economy is a complex mix of modern industry and commerce along with a traditional agriculture sector that still accounts for about 30% of employment. It has a strong and rapidly growing private sector yet the state remains a major participant in basic industry banking transport and communication. The largest industrial sector is textiles and clothing which accounts for one-third of industrial employment; it faces stiff competition in international markets with the end of the global quota system. However other sectors notably the automotive and electronics industries are rising in importance within Turkey's export mix. Real GNP growth has exceeded 6% in many years but this strong expansion has been interrupted by sharp declines in output in 1994 1999 and 2001. The economy turned around with the implementation of economic reforms and 2004 GDP growth reached 9% followed by roughly 5% annual growth from 2005-07. Due to global contractions annual growth is estimated to have fallen to 1.5% in 2008. Inflation fell to 7.7% in 2005 - a 30-year low - but climbed to over 10% in 2008. Despite the strong economic gains from 2002-07 which were largely due to renewed investor interest in emerging markets IMF backing and tighter fiscal policy the economy is still burdened by a high current account deficit and high external debt. Further economic and judicial reforms and prospective EU membership are expected to boost foreign direct investment. The stock value of FDI currently stands at about $85 billion. Privatization sales are currently approaching $21 billion. Oil began to flow through the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan pipeline in May 2006 marking a major milestone that will bring up to 1 million barrels per day from the Caspian to market. In 2007 and 2008 Turkish financial markets weathered significant domestic political turmoil including turbulence sparked by controversy over the selection of former Foreign Minister Abdullah GUL as Turkey's 11th president and the possible closure of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). Economic fundamentals are sound marked by moderate economic growth and foreign direct investment. Nevertheless the Turkish economy may be faced with more negative economic indicators in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown. In addition Turkey's high current account deficit leaves the economy vulnerable to destabilizing shifts in investor confidence.,61976000,2007,29 October 1923 (successor state to the Ottoman Empire),31000000,2007 est.,35830000000,2007 est.,36600000000,2007 est.,0.2,NA,$ -41 600 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,863000000.0,2007 est.,1.9,NA,$ 355 000 000 000,31 December 2007,2004,,16995299.0,2009 est.,Republic Day 29 October (1923),612,2008,0.0,NA,severe earthquakes especially in northern Turkey along an arc extending from the Sea of Marmara to Lake Van,slightly larger than Texas,87.4,2004 est.,71.96,2009 est.,unicameral Grand National Assembly of Turkey or Turkiye Buyuk Millet Meclisi (550 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: last held on 22 July 2007 (next to be held in November 2012) election results: percent of vote by party - AKP 46.7% CHP 20.8% MHP 14.3% independents 5.2% and other 13.0%; seats by party - AKP 341 CHP 112 MHP 71 independents 26; note - seats by party as of 31 January 2009 - AKP 340 CHP 97 MHP 70 DTP 21 DSP 13 ODP 1 BBP 1 independents 5 vacant 2 (DTP entered parliament as independents; DSP entered parliament on CHP's party list); only parties surpassing the 10% threshold are entitled to parliamentary seats,civil law system derived from various European continental legal systems; note - member of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) although Turkey claims limited derogations on the ratified European Convention on Human Rights; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB (nonregional member) Australia Group BIS BSEC CE CERN (observer) EAPC EBRD ECO EU (applicant) FAO G-20 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICRM IDA IDB IEA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA NATO NEA NSG OAS (observer) OECD OIC OPCW OSCE PCA SECI UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNIFIL UNMIS UNOCI UNOMIG UNRWA UNWTO UPU WCO WEU (associate) WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO ZC,6.0,NA,19432688.0,2008 est.,5.3,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Antarctic Treaty Biodiversity Climate Change Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: Environmental Modification,water pollution from dumping of chemicals and detergents; air pollution particularly in urban areas; deforestation; concern for oil spills from increasing Bosporus ship traffic,2.0,2008,3.0,2008,181600000000,2007 est.,8697,2008,Aliaga Diliskelesi Izmir Kocaeli (Izmit) Mercin Limani Nemrut Limani,18.0,NA,-0.6,2008 est.,high central plateau (Anatolia); narrow coastal plain; several mountain ranges,general assessment: comprehensive telecommunications network undergoing rapid modernization and expansion especially in mobile-cellular services domestic: additional digital exchanges are permitting a rapid increase in subscribers; the construction of a network of technologically advanced intercity trunk lines using both fiber-optic cable and digital microwave radio relay is facilitating communication between urban centers; remote areas are reached by a domestic satellite system; the number of subscribers to mobile-cellular telephone service is growing rapidly international: country code - 90; international service is provided by the SEA-ME-WE-3 submarine cable and by submarine fiber-optic cables in the Mediterranean and Black Seas that link Turkey with Italy Greece Israel Bulgaria Romania and Russia; satellite earth stations - 12 Intelsat; mobile satellite terminals - 328 in the Inmarsat and Eutelsat systems (2002),2.21,2009 est.,10.7,2008 est.,republican parliamentary democracy,red with a vertical white crescent (the closed portion is toward the hoist side) and white five-pointed star centered just outside the crescent opening,key transit route for Southwest Asian heroin to Western Europe and to a lesser extent the US - via air land and sea routes; major Turkish and other international trafficking organizations operate out of Istanbul; laboratories to convert imported morphine base into heroin exist in remote regions of Turkey and near Istanbul; government maintains strict controls over areas of legal opium poppy cultivation and over output of poppy straw concentrate; lax enforcement of money-laundering controls,$ 193 900 000 000,2008 est.,426951,2006,1.31,2009 est.,1.5,2008 est.,18.0,2007,$ 906 500 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador James F.

The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian empires until it won independence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City a US Allied and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution a presidential election in 2004 and National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004 Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and the National Assembly was inaugurated the following December.

tribal leaders; ethnically based groups,Afghanistan's economy is recovering from decades of conflict. The economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international assistance the recovery of the agricultural sector and service sector growth. Real GDP growth exceeded 7% in 2008. Despite the progress of the past few years Afghanistan is extremely poor landlocked and highly dependent on foreign aid agriculture and trade with neighboring countries. Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing clean water electricity medical care and jobs. Criminality insecurity and the Afghan Government's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to future economic growth. It will probably take the remainder of the decade and continuing donor aid and attention to significantly raise Afghanistan's living standards from its current level among the lowest in the world. International pledges made by more than 60 countries and international financial institutions at the Berlin Donors Conference for Afghan reconstruction in March 2004 reached $8.9 billion for 2004-09. While the international community remains committed to Afghanistan's development pledging over $57 billion at three donors' conferences since 2002 Kabul will need to overcome a number of challenges. Expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade generate roughly $3 billion in illicit economic activity and looms as one of Kabul's most serious policy concerns. Other long-term challenges include: budget sustainability job creation corruption government capacity and rebuilding war torn infrastructure.,5400000,2008,19 August 1919 (from UK control over Afghan foreign affairs),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,20000000,2006 est.,1.0,NA,$ -67 000 000,2007 est.,,,,,,,,,608000000.0,2007 est.,5.4,NA,$ 12 040 000,31 December 2007,,,4072945.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 19 August (1919),,,258.0,NA,damaging earthquakes occur in Hindu Kush mountains; flooding; droughts,slightly smaller than Texas,28.1,2000 est.,44.64,2009 est.,the bicameral National Assembly consists of the Meshrano Jirga or House of Elders (102 seats one-third elected from provincial councils for four-year terms one-third elected from local district councils for three-year terms and one-third nominated by the president for five-year terms) and the Wolesi Jirga or House of People (no more than 249 seats) directly elected for five-year terms note: on rare occasions the government may convene a Loya Jirga (Grand Council) on issues of independence national sovereignty and territorial integrity; it can amend the provisions of the constitution and prosecute the president; it is made up of members of the National Assembly and chairpersons of the provincial and district councils elections: last held 18 September 2005 (next to be held for the Wolesi Jirga by September 2009; next was to be held for the provincial councils to the Meshrano Jirga by September 2008) election results: the single non-transferable vote (SNTV) system used in the election did not make use of political party slates; most candidates ran as independents,based on mixed civil and Sharia law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB CP ECO FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF Interpol IOC IOM ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU MIGA NAM OIC OPCW OSCE (partner) SAARC SACEP SCO (guest) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO (observer),,,7004819.0,2008 est.,1.9,2006 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection signed but not ratified: Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Life Conservation,limited natural fresh water resources; inadequate supplies of potable water; soil degradation; overgrazing; deforestation (much of the remaining forests are being cut down for fuel and building materials); desertification; air and water pollution,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,839000000,2007 est.,,,Kheyrabad Shir Khan,18.0,NA,,,mostly rugged mountains; plains in north and southwest,general assessment: limited landline telephone service; an increasing number of Afghans utilize mobile-cellular phone networks in major cities domestic: aided by the presence of multiple providers mobile-cellular telephone service is improving rapidly international: country code - 93; five VSAT's installed in Kabul Herat Mazar-e-Sharif Kandahar and Jalalabad provide international and domestic voice and data connectivity (2007),6.53,2009 est.,40.0,2008 est.,Islamic republic,"three equal vertical bands of black (hoist side) red and green with the national emblem in white centered on the red band and slightly overlapping the other two bands; the center of the emblem features a mosque with pulpit and flags on either side below the mosque are numerals for the solar year 1298 (1919 in the Gregorian calendar the year of Afghan independence from the UK); this central image is circled by a border consisting of sheaves of wheat on the left and right in the upper-center is an Arabic inscription of the Shahada (Muslim creed) below which are rays of the rising sun over the Takbir (Arabic expression meaning ""God is great"") and at bottom center is a scroll bearing the name Afghanistan",world's largest producer of opium; poppy cultivation decreased 22% to 157 000 hectares in 2008 but remains at a historically high level; less favorable growing conditions in 2008 reduced potential opium production to 5 500 metric tons down 31 percent from 2007; if the entire opium crop were processed 648 metric tons of pure heroin potentially could be produced; the Taliban and other antigovernment groups participate in and profit from the opiate trade which is a key source of revenue for the Taliban inside Afghanistan; widespread corruption and instability impede counterdrug efforts; most of the heroin consumed in Europe and Eurasia is derived from Afghan opium; vulnerable to drug money laundering through informal financial networks; regional source of hashish (2008),$ 4 850 000 000,2007,42150,2006,2.63,2009 est.,7.5,2008 est.,9.0,2007,$ 23 030 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador (vacant); Deputy Ambassador Francis J.

Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE. Re-elected in May 2006 QARASE was ousted in a December 2006 military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA who initially appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became interim prime minister. Since taking power BAINIMARAMA has neutralized his opponents crippled Fiji's democratic institutions and refused to hold elections.,30.0,2001 est.,sugar garments gold timber fish molasses coconut oil,9.01,31 December 2007,5.66,July 2009 est.,,,$ 3 783 000 000,2008 est.,$ 6 702 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,,,4 divisions and 1 dependency*; Central Eastern Northern Rotuma* Western,28.6,1987,0.07,2000,sugarcane coconuts cassava (tapioca) rice sweet potatoes bananas; cattle pigs horses goats; fish,Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF): Land Forces Naval Forces (2009),21.92,2009 est.,6.5,2004,$ 1 363 000 000,2006,tropical marine; only slight seasonal temperature variation,manufactured goods machinery and transport equipment petroleum products food chemicals,Dodonu Ni Taukei Party or DNT [Fereti S.

Sugar exports remittances from Fijians working abroad and a growing tourist industry - with 400 000 to 500 000 tourists annually - are the major sources of foreign exchange. Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union markets but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar subsidies. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity but is not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged by the December 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time. In 2007 tourist arrivals were down almost 6% with substantial job losses in the service sector and GDP dipped nearly 7%. The coup has created a difficult business climate. The EU has suspended all aid until the interim government takes steps toward new elections. Long-term problems include low investment uncertain land ownership rights and the government's inability to manage its budget. Overseas remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased significantly.

In 1947 West Pakistan and East Bengal (both primarily Muslim) separated from India (largely Hindu) and jointly became the new country of Pakistan. East Bengal became East Pakistan in 1955 but the awkward arrangement of a two-part country with its territorial units separated by 1 600 km left the Bengalis marginalized and dissatisfied. East Pakistan seceded from its union with West Pakistan in 1971 and was renamed Bangladesh. A military-backed emergency caretaker regime suspended parliamentary elections planned for January 2007 in an effort to reform the political system and root out corruption. In contrast to the strikes and violent street rallies that had marked Bangladeshi politics in previous years the parliamentary elections finally held in late December 2008 were mostly peaceful.

Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991 with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two-and-a-half-year border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices in December 2000. Eritrea hosted a UN peacekeeping operation that monitored a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) on the border with Ethiopia. Eritrea's denial of fuel to the mission caused the UN to withdraw the mission and terminate its mandate 31 July 2008. An international commission organized to resolve the border dispute posted its findings in 2002. However both parties have been unable to reach agreement on implementing the decision. On 30 November 2007 the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission remotely demarcated the border by coordinates and dissolved itself leaving Ethiopia still occupying several tracts of disputed territory including the town of Badme.

Eritrea has a command economy under the control of the sole political party the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ). Like the economies of many African nations the economy is largely based on subsistence agriculture with 80% of the population involved in farming and herding. The Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 1998-2000 severely hurt Eritrea's economy. GDP growth fell to zero in 1999 and to -12.1% in 2000. The May 2000 Ethiopian offensive into northern Eritrea caused some $600 million in property damage and loss including losses of $225 million in livestock and 55 000 homes. The attack prevented planting of crops in Eritrea's most productive region causing food production to drop by 62%. Despite the fighting Eritrea developed its transportation infrastructure asphalting new roads improving its ports and repairing war-damaged roads and bridges. Since the war's conclusion the government has maintained a firm grip on the economy expanding the use of the military and party-owned businesses to complete Eritrea's development agenda. The government strictly controls the use of foreign currency by limiting access and availability. Few private enterprises remain in Eritrea. Eritrea's economy depends heavily on taxes paid by members of the diaspora. Erratic rainfall and the delayed demobilization of agriculturalists from the military continue to interfere with agricultural production and Eritrea's recent harvests have been unable to meet the food needs of the country. The Government continues to place its hope for additional revenue on the development of several international mining projects. Despite difficulties for international companies in working with the Eritrean Government a Canadian mining company signed a contract with the Government in 2007 and plans to begin mineral extraction in 2010. Eritrea also opened a free trade zone at the port of Massawa in 2008. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master social problems such as illiteracy unemployment and low skills and more importantly on the government's willingness to support a true market economy.,70000,2007,24 May 1993 (from Ethiopia),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,,,$ -229 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,5.4,NA,$ 1 711 000 000,31 December 2007,,,834018.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 24 May (1993),5,2008,-75.0,NA,frequent droughts; locust swarms,slightly larger than Pennsylvania,58.6,2003 est.,61.78,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly (150 seats; members elected by direct popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: in May 1997 following the adoption of the new constitution 75 members of the PFDJ Central Committee (the old Central Committee of the EPLF) 60 members of the 527-member Constituent Assembly which had been established in 1997 to discuss and ratify the new constitution and 15 representatives of Eritreans living abroad were formed into a Transitional National Assembly to serve as the country's legislative body until countrywide elections to a National Assembly were held; although only 75 of 150 members of the Transitional National Assembly were elected the constitution stipulates that once past the transition stage all members of the National Assembly will be elected by secret ballot of all eligible voters; National Assembly elections scheduled for December 2001 were postponed indefinitely,primary basis is the Ethiopian legal code of 1957 with revisions; new civil commercial and penal codes have not yet been promulgated; government also issues unilateral proclamations setting laws and policies; also relies on customary and post-independence-enacted laws and for civil cases involving Muslims Islamic law; does not accept compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP AfDB AU COMESA FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt (signatory) IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS (observer) ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC ISO (correspondent) ITU ITUC LAS (observer) MIGA NAM OPCW PCA UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO,12.0,NA,1096120.0,2008 est.,6.3,2006 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Ozone Layer Protection signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,deforestation; desertification; soil erosion; overgrazing; loss of infrastructure from civil warfare,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,253000000,2006 est.,306,2008,Assab Massawa,18.0,NA,2.0,2008 est.,dominated by extension of Ethiopian north-south trending highlands descending on the east to a coastal desert plain on the northwest to hilly terrain and on the southwest to flat-to-rolling plains,general assessment: inadequate; combined fixed-line and mobile cellular subscribership is only about 2 per 100 persons domestic: inadequate; most telephones are in Asmara; government is seeking international tenders to improve the system (2002) international: country code - 291; note - international connections exist,4.72,2009 est.,,,transitional government note: following a successful referendum on independence for the Autonomous Region of Eritrea on 23-25 April 1993 a National Assembly composed entirely of the People's Front for Democracy and Justice or PFDJ was established as a transitional legislature; a Constitutional Commission was also established to draft a constitution; ISAIAS Afworki was elected president by the transitional legislature; the constitution ratified in May 1997 did not enter into effect pending parliamentary and presidential elections; parliamentary elections were scheduled in December 2001 but were postponed indefinitely; currently the sole legal party is the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ),red isosceles triangle (based on the hoist side) dividing the flag into two right triangles; the upper triangle is green the lower one is blue; a gold wreath encircling a gold olive branch is centered on the hoist side of the red triangle,,$ 601 000 000,2008 est.,4010,2000,2.58,2009 est.,2.0,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 3 946 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Ronald MCMULLEN embassy: 179 Ala Street Asmara mailing address: P.

The tourism sector is likely to face declining revenues with the global economic downturn as US and European travel declines. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area and the government is trying to revitalize the banana industry although recent hurricanes have caused exports to contract. Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a variety of external shocks including volatile tourism receipts natural disasters and dependence on foreign oil.

Under a series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September 1999 Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security and civilian responsibility for Palestinian-populated areas of the West Bank and Gaza. Negotiations to determine the permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza stalled following the outbreak of an intifada in September 2000 as Israeli forces reoccupied most Palestinian-controlled areas. In April 2003 the Quartet (US EU UN and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states Israel and a democratic Palestine. The proposed date for a permanent status agreement was postponed indefinitely due to violence and accusations that both sides had not followed through on their commitments. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late 2004 Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month later Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005 Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank settlements. Nonetheless Israel controls maritime airspace and most access to the Gaza Strip. A November 2005 PA-Israeli agreement authorized the reopening of the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt under joint PA and Egyptian control. In January 2006 the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS won control of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). The international community refused to accept the HAMAS-led government because it did not recognize Israel would not renounce violence and refused to honor previous peace agreements between Israel and the PA. HAMAS took control of the PA government in March 2006 but President ABBAS had little success negotiating with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the international community so as to lift economic sanctions on Palestinians. The PLC was unable to convene throughout most of 2006 as a result of Israel's detention of many HAMAS PLC members and Israeli-imposed travel restrictions on other PLC members. Violent clashes took place between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulting in numerous Palestinian deaths and injuries. ABBAS and HAMAS Political Bureau Chief MISHAL in February 2007 signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA. However fighting continued in the Gaza Strip and in June HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG and through a series of Presidential decrees formed a PA government in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the NUG's dismissal and has called for resuming talks with Fatah but ABBAS has ruled out negotiations until HAMAS agrees to a return of PA control over the Gaza Strip and recognizes the FAYYAD-led government. FAYYAD and his PA government initiated a series of security and economic reforms to improve conditions in the West Bank. ABBAS participated in talks with Israel's Prime Minister OLMERT and secured the release of some Palestinian prisoners and previously withheld customs revenue. During a November 2007 international meeting in Annapolis Maryland ABBAS and OLMERT agreed to resume peace negotiations with the goal of reaching a final peace settlement. Late November 2007 through June 2008 witnessed a substantial increase in Israeli-Palestinian violence. An Egyptian-brokered truce in June 2008 between Israel and HAMAS brought about a five-month pause in hostilities but spiraling end-of-year violence culminated with massive Israeli air assaults on HAMAS installations in late December followed by Israeli ground attacks in early January 2009. Israel in mid January unilaterally stopped the attacks and HAMAS responded by suspending rocket and mortar fire. The fighting resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1 100 to 1 400 Palestinians and left tens of thousands of people homeless. International donors pledged $4.5 billion in aid to rebuild the Gaza Strip but by mid-May 2009 only a small fraction of the aid had been delivered.,5.0,June 2008,citrus flowers textiles,7.73,31 December 2006,3.44,July 2009 est.,,,$ 6 641 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,,olives citrus fruit vegetables flowers beef dairy products,Palestinian Authority security forces have operated only in the West Bank not in the Gaza Strip since Hamas seized power in June 2007; law and order and other security functions are performed by Hamas security organizations (2008),36.93,2009 est.,,,$ 1 149 000 000,2006,temperate mild winters dry and warm to hot summers,food consumer goods construction materials,,1551859,July 2009 est.,noun: NA adjective: NA,arable land natural gas,0.0,2009 est.,strategic strip of land along Mideast-North African trade routes has experienced an incredibly turbulent history; the town of Gaza itself has been besieged countless times in its history,,High population density limited land access and strict internal and external security controls have kept economic conditions in the Gaza Strip - the smaller of the two areas under the Palestinian Authority (PA) - even more degraded than in the West Bank. The beginning of the second intifada in September 2000 sparked an economic downturn largely the result of Israeli closure policies; these policies which were imposed to address security concerns in Israel disrupted labor and trade access to and from the Gaza Strip. In 2001 and even more severely in 2003 Israeli military measures in PA areas resulted in the destruction of capital the disruption of administrative structures and widespread business closures. The Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in September 2005 offered some medium-term opportunities for economic growth but Israeli-imposed crossings closures which became more restrictive after HAMAS violently took over the territory in June 2007 have resulted in widespread private sector layoffs and shortages of most goods. The status of the crossings which are closed to all but the most basic goods has not changed following Israel's military offensive into the Gaza Strip in early 2009.,1026000,2007,,,,,,,,0.7,NA,,,,,,,,,,,90000.0,2005,3.3,NA,$ 368 200 000,31 December 2007,,,297380.0,2009 est.,,,,0.0,NA,droughts,slightly more than twice the size of Washington DC,92.4,2004 est.,73.42,2009 est.,,,,,,337670.0,2008 est.,,,,desertification; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne disease; soil degradation; depletion and contamination of underground water resources,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,140000,2005,,,Gaza,,,2.4,2005,flat to rolling sand- and dune-covered coastal plain,general assessment: NA domestic: Israeli company BEZEK and the Palestinian company PALTEL are responsible for fixed line services; the Palestinian JAWAL company provides cellular services international: country code - 970 (2004),5.03,2009 est.,41.3,June 2008,,,,$ 2 840 000 000,2006,,,3.35,2009 est.,0.8,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 11 950 000 000,2008 est.,,$ 2 900,2008 est.,,

After his death the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states but these broke apart in the 14th century. The Mongols eventually retired to their original steppe homelands and in the late 17th century came under Chinese rule. Mongolia won its independence in 1921 with Soviet backing and a Communist regime was installed in 1924. The modern country of Mongolia however represents only part of the Mongols' historical homeland; more Mongols live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China than in Mongolia. Following a peaceful democratic revolution the ex-Communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) won elections in 1990 and 1992 but was defeated by the Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) in the 1996 parliamentary election. The MPRP won an overwhelming majority in the 2000 parliamentary election but the party lost seats in the 2004 election and shared power with democratic coalition parties from 2004-08. The MPRP regained a solid majority in the 2008 parliamentary elections but nevertheless formed a coalition government with the Democratic Party. The prime minister and most cabinet members are MPRP members.,5.0,2008,copper apparel livestock animal products cashmere wool hides fluorspar other nonferrous metals coal,17.54,31 December 2007,6.12,July 2009 est.,,,$ 4 991 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,21 provinces (aymguud singular - aymag) and 1 municipality* (singular - hot); Arhangay Bayanhongor Bayan-Olgiy Bulgan Darhan-Uul Dornod Dornogovi Dundgovi Dzavhan (Zavkhan) Govi-Altay Govisumber Hentiy Hovd Hovsgol Omnogovi Orhon Ovorhangay Selenge Suhbaatar Tov Ulaanbaatar* Uvs,34.8,1999,0.44,2000,wheat barley vegetables forage crops; sheep goats cattle camels horses,Mongolian Armed Forces: Mongolian Army Mongolian Air Force; there is no navy (2009),21.05,2009 est.,5.0,2004,$ 1 710 000 000,2008,desert; continental (large daily and seasonal temperature ranges),machinery and equipment fuel cars food products industrial consumer goods chemicals building materials sugar tea,Democratic Party or DP [Norov ALTANHUYAG]; Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party or MPRP [Sanjaa BAYAR],3041142,July 2009 est.,noun: Mongolian(s) adjective: Mongolian,oil coal copper molybdenum tungsten phosphates tin nickel zinc fluorspar gold silver iron,,,landlocked; strategic location between China and Russia,other: human rights groups; women's groups,Economic activity in Mongolia has traditionally been based on herding and agriculture. Mongolia has extensive mineral deposits. Copper coal gold molybdenum fluorspar uranium tin and tungsten account for a large part of industrial production and foreign direct investment. Soviet assistance at its height one-third of GDP disappeared almost overnight in 1990 and 1991 at the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. The following decade saw Mongolia endure both deep recession because of political inaction and natural disasters as well as economic growth because of reform-embracing free-market economics and extensive privatization of the formerly state-run economy. Severe winters and summer droughts in 2000-02 resulted in massive livestock die-off and zero or negative GDP growth. This was compounded by falling prices for Mongolia's primary sector exports and widespread opposition to privatization. Growth averaged nearly 9% per year in 2004-08 largely because of high copper prices and new gold production. Until late 2008 Mongolia experienced a soaring inflation rate with year-to-year inflation reaching nearly 40% - the highest inflation rate in over a decade. In late 2008 falling commodity prices in this import-reliant country helped lower inflation but by that time the country had begun to feel the effects of the global financial crisis. Falling prices for copper and other mineral exports reduced government revenues and is forcing cuts in spending. The global credit crisis has stalled growth in key sectors especially those that had been fueled by foreign investment. Mongolia's economy continues to be heavily influenced by its neighbors. Mongolia purchases 95% of its petroleum products and a substantial amount of electric power from Russia leaving it vulnerable to price increases. Trade with China represents more than half of Mongolia's total external trade - China receives about 70% of Mongolia's exports. Remittances from Mongolians working abroad both legally and illegally are sizable but have fallen due to the economic crisis; money laundering is a growing concern. Mongolia settled its $11 billion debt with Russia at the end of 2003 on favorable terms. Mongolia which joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 seeks to expand its participation and integration into Asian regional economic and trade regimes.,1796000,2008,11 July 1921 (from China),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,4.0,2004,$ -1 000 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,197500000.0,2008,1.2,NA,$ 1 183 000 000,31 December 2007,,,706774.0,2009 est.,Independence Day/Revolution Day 11 July (1921),77,2008,518.0,NA,"dust storms; grassland and forest fires; drought; ""zud "" which is harsh winter conditions",slightly smaller than Alaska,97.8,2000 census,67.65,2009 est.,unicameral State Great Hural 76 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms elections: last held 29 June 2008 (next to be held in June 2012) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - MPRP 45 DP 27 others 4; note - 1 seat disputed and unfilled,"blend of Soviet and German systems that employ ""continental"" or ""civil"" code; case-precedent may be used to inform judges but all decisions must refer to the law as written; constitution ambiguous on judicial review of legislative acts; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction",ADB ARF CP EBRD FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MINURSO MONUC NAM OPCW OSCE (partner) SCO (observer) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNMIL UNMIS UNOMIG UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,,,860669.0,2008 est.,1.4,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,limited natural fresh water resources in some areas; the policies of former Communist regimes promoted rapid urbanization and industrial growth that had negative effects on the environment; the burning of soft coal in power plants and the lack of enforcement of environmental laws severely polluted the air in Ulaanbaatar; deforestation overgrazing and the converting of virgin land to agricultural production increased soil erosion from wind and rain; desertification and mining activities had a deleterious effect on the environment,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,3979000000,2008,1810,2008,,18.0,NA,3.0,2006 est.,vast semidesert and desert plains grassy steppe mountains in west and southwest; Gobi Desert in south-central,general assessment: network is improving with international direct dialing available in many areas domestic: very low fixed-line density; there are multiple mobile cellular service providers and subscribership is increasing rapidly; a fiber-optic network has been installed that is improving broadband and communication services between major urban centers with multiple companies providing inter-city fiber-optic cable services international: country code - 976; satellite earth stations - 7,2.23,2009 est.,2.8,2008,parliamentary,"three equal vertical bands of red (hoist side) blue and red; centered on the hoist-side red band in yellow is the national emblem (""soyombo"" - a columnar arrangement of abstract and geometric representation for fire sun moon earth water and the yin-yang symbol)",,$ 3 615 000 000,2008,49249,2008,1.49,2009 est.,8.9,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 9 557 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Mark C.

The government has partially or fully privatized many large companies banks and insurers and has ceded stakes in such leading firms as Air France France Telecom Renault and Thales. It maintains a strong presence in some sectors particularly power public transport and defense industries. The telecommunications sector is gradually being opened to competition. France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws tax policies and social spending that reduce income disparity and the impact of free markets on public health and welfare. Widespread opposition to labor reform has in recent years hampered the government's ability to revitalize the economy. During 2007-08 the government implemented several important labor reforms including a de facto extension of the 35-hour workweek by allowing employees to work longer overtime hours. During 2009 the government is expected to delay or even renounce other reform efforts due to the on-going financial crisis. GDP growth dropped to 0.7% in 2008; the French government plans to increase public investment and continue injecting capital into the banking sector to alleviate the negative effects of the crisis during 2009. As a result of lower fiscal revenues and increased expenditures the general government deficit is expected to exceed the euro-zone ceiling 3% of GDP. France's tax burden remains one of the highest in Europe - at nearly 50% of GDP in 2005.

Over the next several years thousands of Tutsis were killed and some 150 000 driven into exile in neighboring countries. The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and began a civil war in 1990. The war along with several political and economic upheavals exacerbated ethnic tensions culminating in April 1994 in the genocide of roughly 800 000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Tutsi rebels defeated the Hutu regime and ended the killing in July 1994 but approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi Tanzania Uganda and Zaire. Since then most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda but several thousand remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC; the former Zaire) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda much as the RPF tried in 1990. Despite substantial international assistance and political reforms - including Rwanda's first local elections in March 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in August and September 2003 - the country continues to struggle to boost investment and agricultural output and ethnic reconciliation is complicated by the real and perceived Tutsi political dominance. Kigali's increasing centralization and intolerance of dissent the nagging Hutu extremist insurgency across the border and Rwandan involvement in two wars in recent years in the neighboring DRC continue to hinder Rwanda's efforts to escape its bloody legacy.,10.0,2000,coffee tea hides tin ore,15.84,31 December 2007,14.02,July 2009 est.,,,$ 4 027 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,4 provinces (in French - provinces singular - province; in Kinyarwanda - intara for singular and plural) and 1 city* (in French - ville; in Kinyarwanda - umujyi); Est (Eastern) Kigali* Nord (Northern) Ouest (Western) Sud (Southern),5.2,2003,0.15,2000,coffee tea pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums) bananas beans sorghum potatoes; livestock,Rwandan Defense Forces: Army Air Force,39.67,2009 est.,3.8,2005,$ 930 400 000,2008 est.,temperate; two rainy seasons (February to April November to January); mild in mountains with frost and snow possible,foodstuffs machinery and equipment steel petroleum products cement and construction material,Centrist Democratic Party or PDC [Alfred MUKEZAMFURA]; Democratic Popular Union of Rwanda or UDPR [Adrien RANGIRA]; Democratic Republican Movement or MDR [Celestin KABANDA] (officially banned); Islamic Democratic Party or PDI [Andre BUMAYA]; Liberal Party or PL [Protais MITALI]; Party for Democratic Renewal (officially banned); Rwandan Patriotic Front or RPF [Paul KAGAME]; Social Democratic Party or PSD [Vincent BIRUTA],10473282,July 2009 est.,noun: Rwandan(s) adjective: Rwandan,gold cassiterite (tin ore) wolframite (tungsten ore) methane hydropower arable land,2.17,2009 est.,landlocked; most of the country is savanna grassland with the population predominantly rural,IBUKA (association of genocide survivors),Rwanda is a poor rural country with about 90% of the population engaged in (mainly subsistence) agriculture. It is the most densely populated country in Africa and is landlocked with few natural resources and minimal industry. Primary foreign exchange earners are coffee and tea. The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base severely impoverished the population particularly women and eroded the country's ability to attract private and external investment. However Rwanda has made substantial progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy to pre-1994 levels although poverty levels are higher now. GDP has rebounded and inflation has been curbed. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem food production often does not keep pace with population growth requiring food imports. Rwanda continues to receive substantial aid money and obtained IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative debt relief in 2005-06. Rwanda also received Millennium Challenge Account Threshold status in 2006. The government has embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce poverty by improving education infrastructure and foreign and domestic investment and pursuing market-oriented reforms although energy shortages instability in neighboring states and lack of adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to handicap growth.,635100,2007,1 July 1962 (from Belgium-administered UN trusteeship),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0.1,NA,$ -265 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,130000000.0,2007 est.,4.2,NA,$ 209 200 000,31 December 2005,,,1452768.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 1 July (1962),,,950.0,NA,periodic droughts; the volcanic Virunga mountains are in the northwest along the border with Democratic Republic of the Congo,slightly smaller than Maryland,70.4,2003 est.,50.52,2009 est.,bicameral Parliament consists of Senate (26 seats; 12 members elected by local councils 8 appointed by the president 4 by the Political Organizations Forum 2 represent institutions of higher learning; to serve eight-year terms) and Chamber of Deputies (80 seats; 53 members elected by popular vote 24 women elected by local bodies 3 selected by youth and disability organizations; serve five-year terms) elections: Senate - members appointed as part of the transitional government (next to be held in 2011); Chamber of Deputies - last held 15 September 2008 (next to be held September 2013) election results: percent of vote by party - RPF 78.8% PSD 13.1% PL 7.5%; seats by party - RPF 42 PSD 7 PL 4 additional 27 members indirectly elected,based on German and Belgian civil law systems and customary law; judicial review of legislative acts in the Supreme Court; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP AfDB AU CEPGL COMESA EAC EADB FAO G-77 IBRD ICAO ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MINURCAT NAM OIF OPCW UN UNAMID UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNMIS UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,,,2392933.0,2008 est.,2.9,2006 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Ozone Layer Protection Wetlands signed but not ratified: Law of the Sea,deforestation results from uncontrolled cutting of trees for fuel; overgrazing; soil exhaustion; soil erosion; widespread poaching,2.0,2008,1.0,2008,134000000,2006 est.,,,Cyangugu Gisenyi Kibuye,18.0,NA,7.5,2008 est.,mostly grassy uplands and hills; relief is mountainous with altitude declining from west to east,general assessment: small inadequate telephone system primarily serves business and government domestic: the capital Kigali is connected to the centers of the provinces by microwave radio relay and recently by cellular telephone service; much of the network depends on wire and HF radiotelephone; combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone density is only about 7 telephones per 100 persons international: country code - 250; international connections employ microwave radio relay to neighboring countries and satellite communications to more distant countries; satellite earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) in Kigali (includes telex and telefax service),5.25,2009 est.,,,republic; presidential multiparty system,three horizontal bands of sky blue (top double width) yellow and green with a golden sun with 24 rays near the fly end of the blue band,,$ 809 000 000,2008 est.,14008,2004,2.78,2009 est.,7.5,2008 est.,,,$ 9 061 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador W.

Reforms to the taxation healthcare pension and social welfare systems helped Slovakia to consolidate its budget and get on track to join the EU in 2004 and to adopt the euro in January 2009. Major privatizations are nearly complete the banking sector is almost entirely in foreign hands and the government has helped facilitate a foreign investment boom with business friendly policies such as labor market liberalization and a 19% flat tax. Foreign investment in the automotive and electronic sectors has been strong. Slovakia's economic growth exceeded expectations in 2001-08 despite the general European slowdown. Unemployment at an unacceptable 18% in 2003-04 dropped to 8.4% in 2008 but remains the economy's Achilles heel. Despite its 2006 pre-election promises to loosen fiscal policy and reverse the previous DZURINDA government's pro-market reforms FICO's cabinet has thus far been careful to keep a lid on spending in order to meet euro adoption criteria and has focused on regulating energy and food prices instead.

In 1969 a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre ushered in an authoritarian socialist rule that managed to impose a degree of stability in the country for a couple of decades. After the regime's collapse early in 1991 Somalia descended into turmoil factional fighting and anarchy. In May 1991 northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal Woqooyi Galbeed Togdheer Sanaag and Sool. Although not recognized by any government this entity has maintained a stable existence and continues efforts to establish a constitutional democracy including holding municipal parliamentary and presidential elections. The regions of Bari Nugaal and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring self-declared autonomous state of Puntland which has been self-governing since 1998 but does not aim at independence; it has also made strides toward reconstructing a legitimate representative government but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its border with Somaliland as it also claims portions of eastern Sool and Sanaag. Beginning in 1993 a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions but when the UN withdrew in 1995 having suffered significant casualties order still had not been restored. A two-year peace process led by the Government of Kenya under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) concluded in October 2004 with the election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of Somalia and the formation of an interim government known as the Somalia Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs). The TFIs included a 275-member parliamentary body known as the Transitional Federal Assembly (TFA). President YUSUF resigned late in 2008 while United Nations-sponsored talks between the TFG and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) were underway in Djibouti. In January 2009 following the creation of a TFG-ARS unity government Ethiopian military forces which had entered Somalia in December 2006 to support the TFG in the face of advances by the opposition Council of Islamic Courts (CIC) withdrew from the country. The TFA was increased to 550 seats with the addition of 275 ARS members of parliament. The expanded parliament elected Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh Ahmed the former CIC and ARS chairman as president on 31 January 2009 in Djibouti. Subsequently President SHARIF appointed Omar Abdirashid ali SHARMARKE son of a former president of Somalia as prime minister on 13 February 2009. The TFIs are based on the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC) which outlines a five-year mandate leading to the establishment of a new Somali constitution and a transition to a representative government following national elections. However in January 2009 the TFA amended the TFC to extend TFG's mandate until 2011. While its institutions remain weak the TFG continues to reach out to Somali stakeholders and work with international donors to help build the governance capacity of the TFIs and work toward national elections in 2011.,29.0,1975,livestock bananas hides fish charcoal scrap metal,,,15.55,July 2009 est.,,,$ 2 600 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,18 regions (plural - NA singular - gobolka); Awdal Bakool Banaadir Bari Bay Galguduud Gedo Hiiraan Jubbada Dhexe Jubbada Hoose Mudug Nugaal Sanaag Shabeellaha Dhexe Shabeellaha Hoose Sool Togdheer Woqooyi Galbeed,15.7,1997,3.29,2000,bananas sorghum corn coconuts rice sugarcane mangoes sesame seeds beans; cattle sheep goats; fish,no national-level armed forces (2008),43.7,2009 est.,,,,,principally desert; northeast monsoon (December to February) moderate temperatures in north and hot in south; southwest monsoon (May to October) torrid in the north and hot in the south irregular rainfall hot and humid periods (tangambili) between monsoons,manufactures petroleum products foodstuffs construction materials qat,none,9832017,July 2009 est.,noun: Somali(s) adjective: Somali,uranium and largely unexploited reserves of iron ore tin gypsum bauxite copper salt natural gas likely oil reserves,0.0,2009 est.,strategic location on Horn of Africa along southern approaches to Bab el Mandeb and route through Red Sea and Suez Canal,other: numerous clan and sub-clan factions exist both in support and in opposition to the transitional government,Despite the lack of effective national governance Somalia has maintained a healthy informal economy largely based on livestock remittance/money transfer companies and telecommunications. Agriculture is the most important sector with livestock normally accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and semi-pastoralists who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood make up a large portion of the population. Livestock hides fish charcoal and bananas are Somalia's principal exports while sugar sorghum corn qat and machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's small industrial sector based on the processing of agricultural products has largely been looted and sold as scrap metal. Somalia's service sector also has grown. Telecommunication firms provide wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest international call rates on the continent. In the absence of a formal banking sector money transfer/remittance services have sprouted throughout the country handling roughly $2 billion in remittances annually. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of goods from food to the newest electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to operate and are supported with private-security militias. Somalia's arrears to the IMF continued to grow in 2008.

Peruvian independence was declared in 1821 and remaining Spanish forces defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of military rule Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980 but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime which led to his ouster in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw new elections in the spring of 2001 which ushered in Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of government - Peru's first democratically elected president of Native American ethnicity.

Abundant mineral resources are found in the mountainous areas and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent fishing grounds. The Peruvian economy grew by more than 4% per year during the period 2002-06 with a stable exchange rate and low inflation. Growth jumped to 9% per year in 2007 and 2008 driven by higher world prices for minerals and metals and the government's aggressive trade liberalization strategies. Peru's rapid expansion has helped to reduce the national poverty rate by about 15% since 2002 though underemployment and inflation remain high. Despite Peru's strong macroeconomic performance overdependence on minerals and metals subjects the economy to fluctuations in world prices and poor infrastructure precludes the spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal areas. Not all Peruvians therefore have shared in the benefits of growth. President GARCIA's pursuit of sound trade and macroeconomic policies has cost him political support since his election. Nevertheless he remains committed to Peru's free-trade path.

For 300 years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and Thailand as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries of gradual decline Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975 the Communist Pathet Lao took control of the government ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1986.

The results starting from an extremely low base were striking - growth averaged 6% per year from 1988-2008 except during the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997. Despite this high growth rate Laos remains a country with an underdeveloped infrastructure particularly in rural areas. It has no railroads a rudimentary road system and limited external and internal telecommunications though the government is sponsoring major improvements in the road system with support from Japan and China. Electricity is available in urban areas and in many rural districts. Subsistence agriculture dominated by rice accounts for about 40% of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The government depends upon aid from international donors for over 80% of its capital investment. The economy has until recently benefited from high foreign investment in hydropower mining and construction. The fiscal crisis of late 2008 and the rapid drop in commodity prices - especially copper - has slowed these investments. Several policy changes since 2004 may help spur growth. Laos which gained Normal Trade Relations status with the US in 2004 is taking steps to join the World Trade Organization. Related trade policy reforms will improve the business environment. On the fiscal side a value-added tax (VAT) regime which began with a few large businesses in early 2009 should slowly help streamline the government's inefficient tax system. Economic prospects will improve gradually as the administration continues to simplify investment procedures and as a more competitive banking sector extends credit to small farmers and small entrepreneurs. The government appears committed to raising the country's profile among investors. Foreign donors have praised the Lao government for its efforts to improve the investment regime. The World Bank has declared that Laos' goal of graduating from the UN Development Program's list of least-developed countries by 2020 could be achievable.,1478000,2007,19 July 1949 (from France),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,1.5,2005 census,$ -52 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,367000000.0,2006 est.,5.6,NA,$ 285 800 000,31 December 2007,,,1023205.0,2009 est.,Republic Day 2 December (1975),1,2008,70.0,NA,floods droughts,slightly larger than Utah,68.7,2001 est.,56.68,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly (115 seats; members elected by popular vote from a list of candidates selected by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party to serve five-year terms) elections: last held 30 April 2006 (next to be held in 2011) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - LPRP 113 independents 2,based on traditional customs French legal norms and procedures and socialist practice; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB APT ARF ASEAN CP EAS FAO G-77 IBRD ICAO ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF Interpol IOC IPU ISO (subscriber) ITU MIGA NAM OIF OPCW PCA UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO (observer),,,1549774.0,2008 est.,0.5,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,unexploded ordnance; deforestation; soil erosion; most of the population does not have access to potable water,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,1639000000,2006 est.,,,,18.0,NA,11.0,2008 est.,mostly rugged mountains; some plains and plateaus,general assessment: service to general public is poor but improving; the government relies on a radiotelephone network to communicate with remote areas domestic: multiple service providers; mobile cellular usage growing rapidly; combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular subscribership about 25 per 100 persons international: country code - 856; satellite earth station - 1 Intersputnik (Indian Ocean region) (2007),4.41,2009 est.,2.4,2005 est.,Communist state,three horizontal bands of red (top) blue (double width) and red with a large white disk centered in the blue band,estimated opium poppy cultivation in 2008 was 1 900 hectares about a 73% increase from 2007; estimated potential opium production in 2008 more than tripled to 17 metric tons; unsubstantiated reports of domestic methamphetamine production; growing domestic methamphetamine problem (2007),$ 1 384 000 000,2008 est.,29811,2006,2.32,2009 est.,7.5,2008 est.,,,$ 13 990 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Ravic R.

The region where the cold waters of the ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border - the Antarctic Convergence - which fluctuates with the seasons but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region. The Convergence concentrates nutrients which promotes marine plant life and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life. In the spring of 2000 the International Hydrographic Organization decided to delimit the waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean - the Southern Ocean - by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit and which approximates the extent of the Antarctic Convergence. As such the Southern Ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean but larger than the Arctic Ocean). It should be noted that inclusion of the Southern Ocean does not imply recognition of this feature as one of the world's primary oceans by the US Government.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sea temperatures vary from about 10 degrees Celsius to -2 degrees Celsius; cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently are intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean; the ocean area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth; in winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius; at some coastal points intense persistent drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter,,,,,,probable large and possible giant oil and gas fields on the continental margin; manganese nodules possible placer deposits sand and gravel fresh water as icebergs; squid whales and seals - none exploited; krill fish,,,the major chokepoint is the Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica; the Polar Front (Antarctic Convergence) is the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern Ocean; it is a distinct region at the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that separates the cold polar surface waters to the south from the warmer waters to the north; the Front and the Current extend entirely around Antarctica reaching south of 60 degrees south near New Zealand and near 48 degrees south in the far South Atlantic coinciding with the path of the maximum westerly winds,,Fisheries in 2006-07 landed 126 976 metric tons of which 82% (104 586 tons) was krill (Euphausia superba) and 9.5% (12 027 tons) Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides - also known as Chilean sea bass) compared to 127 910 tons in 2005-06 of which 83% (106 591 tons) was krill and 9.7% (12 396 tons) Patagonian toothfish (estimated fishing from the area covered by the Convention of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) which extends slightly beyond the Southern Ocean area).

The island was annexed by Germany in 1888. Its phosphate deposits began to be mined early in the 20th century by a German-British consortium. Nauru was occupied by Australian forces in World War I and subsequently became a League of Nations mandate.

An Australian company in 2005 entered into an agreement intended to exploit remaining supplies. Few other resources exist with most necessities being imported mainly from Australia its former occupier and later major source of support. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems. Reserves of phosphates may only last until 2010 at current mining rates. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate deposits substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's economic future. As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds the government faces virtual bankruptcy. To cut costs the government has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments. Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia's refugee processing center making it almost totally dependent on food imports and foreign aid.

Growth has been led by the tourist sector which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings and by tuna fishing. In recent years the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming fishing and small-scale manufacturing. GDP grew about 7-8% per year in 2006-07 driven by tourism and a boom in tourism-related construction. The Seychelles rupee was allowed to depreciate in 2006 after being overvalued for years and fell by 10% in the first 9 months of 2007. Despite these actions the Seychelles economy has struggled to maintain its gains and in 2008 suffered from food and oil price shocks a foreign exchange shortage high inflation and large financing gaps with GDP growth reduced to about 3% in 2008.

Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In 1397 Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814 Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949 neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. The current focus is on containing spending on the extensive welfare system and planning for the time when petroleum reserves are depleted.

The government controls key areas such as the vital petroleum sector through large-scale state enterprises. The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum hydropower fish forests and minerals - and is highly dependent on the petroleum sector which accounts for nearly half of exports and over 30% of state revenue. Norway is the world's third-largest gas exporter; its position as an oil exporter has slipped to seventh-largest as production has begun to decline. Norway opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994; nonetheless as a member of the European Economic Area it contributes sizably to the EU budget. In anticipation of eventual declines in oil and gas production Norway saves almost all state revenue from the petroleum sector in a sovereign wealth fund. After lackluster growth of less than 1.5% in 2002-03 GDP growth picked up to 2.5-6.2% in 2004-07 partly due to higher oil prices. Growth fell to 2.3% in 2008 as a result of the slowing world economy and the drop in oil prices.,5192000,2007,7 June 1905 (Norway declared the union with Sweden dissolved); 26 October 1905 (Sweden agreed to the repeal of the union),85700000000,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,6500000000,2007 est.,1.0,2004,$ 83 500 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,3450000000.0,2008 est.,0.7,NA,,,,,863255.0,2009 est.,Constitution Day 17 May (1814),688,2008,0.0,NA,rockslides avalanches,slightly larger than New Mexico,100.0,NA,79.95,2009 est.,modified unicameral Parliament or Storting (169 seats; members are elected by popular vote by proportional representation to serve four-year terms); note - in 2009 the number of seats will change to 165 elections: last held 12 September 2005 (next to be held in September 2009) election results: percent of vote by party - Labor Party 32.7% Progress Party 22.1% Conservative Party 14.1% Socialist Left Party 8.8% Christian People's Party 6.8% Center Party 6.5% Liberal Party 5.9% other 3.1%; seats by party - Labor Party 61 Progress Party 38 Conservative Party 23 Socialist Left Party 15 Christian People's Party 11 Center Party 11 Liberal Party 10 note: for certain purposes the parliament divides itself into two chambers and elects one-fourth of its membership in the Lagting and three-fourths of its membership in the Odelsting,mixture of customary law civil law system and common law traditions; Supreme Court renders advisory opinions to legislature when asked; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,ADB (nonregional member) AfDB (nonregional member) Arctic Council Australia Group BIS CBSS CE CERN EAPC EBRD EFTA ESA FAO IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IEA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA NAM (guest) NATO NC NEA NIB NSG OAS (observer) OECD OPCW OSCE Paris Club PCA Schengen Convention UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNIFIL UNITAR UNMIS UNRWA UNTSO UNWTO UPU WCO WEU (associate) WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO ZC,10.0,NA,1046550.0,2008 est.,1.9,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants Air Pollution-Sulfur 85 Air Pollution-Sulfur 94 Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds Antarctic-Environmental Protocol Antarctic-Marine Living Resources Antarctic Seals Antarctic Treaty Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,water pollution; acid rain damaging forests and adversely affecting lakes threatening fish stocks; air pollution from vehicle emissions,6.0,2008,12.0,2008,142700000000,2008 est.,4114,2009,Bergen Borg Havn Haugesund Maaloy Mongstad Narvik Oslo Sture,18.0,NA,-0.2,2008 est.,glaciated; mostly high plateaus and rugged mountains broken by fertile valleys; small scattered plains; coastline deeply indented by fjords; arctic tundra in north,general assessment: modern in all respects; one of the most advanced telecommunications networks in Europe domestic: Norway has a domestic satellite system; moreover the prevalence of rural areas encourages the wide use of cellular-mobile systems instead of fixed-wire systems international: country code - 47; 2 buried coaxial cable systems; submarine cables provide links to other Nordic countries and Europe; satellite earth stations - NA Eutelsat NA Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) and 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note - Norway shares the Inmarsat earth station with the other Nordic countries (Denmark Finland Iceland and Sweden) (1999),1.78,2009 est.,2.6,2008 est.,constitutional monarchy,red with a blue cross outlined in white that extends to the edges of the flag; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side in the style of the Dannebrog (Danish flag),,$ 85 990 000 000,2008 est.,92946,2007,0.34,2009 est.,1.8,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 256 500 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Benson K.

The economy is predominately agricultural with about 85% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for more than one-third of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for more than half of exports. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF the World Bank and individual donor nations. In December 2007 the US granted Malawi eligibility status to receive financial support within the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) initiative. Malawi will now begin a consultative process to develop a five-year program before funding can begin. In 2006 Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. The government faces many challenges including developing a market economy improving educational facilities facing up to environmental problems dealing with the rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS and satisfying foreign donors that fiscal discipline is being tightened. In 2005 President MUTHARIKA championed an anticorruption campaign. Since 2005 President MUTHARIKA'S government has exhibited improved financial discipline under the guidance of Finance Minister Goodall GONDWE and signed a three year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility worth $56 million with the IMF. Improved relations with the IMF lead other international donors to resume aid as well.,1051000,2007,6 July 1964 (from the UK),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,3.0,1998 census,$ -241 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,5.2,NA,$ 406 200 000,31 December 2007,,,1562107.0,2009 est.,Independence Day (Republic Day) 6 July (1964),,,37.0,NA,NA,slightly smaller than Pennsylvania,62.7,2003 est.,43.82,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly (193 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: last held 19 May 2009 (next to be held in May 2014) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - DPP 114 MCP 26 UDF 17 independents 32 other 4,based on English common law and customary law; judicial review of legislative acts in the Supreme Court of Appeal; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,ACP AfDB AU C COMESA FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MONUC NAM OPCW SADC UN UNAMID UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNMIL UNMIS UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,,,3050444.0,2008 est.,1.3,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: Law of the Sea,deforestation; land degradation; water pollution from agricultural runoff sewage industrial wastes; siltation of spawning grounds endangers fish populations,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,1130000000,2006 est.,797,2008,Chipoka Monkey Bay Nkhata Bay Nkhotakota Chilumba,18.0,NA,4.0,2008 est.,narrow elongated plateau with rolling plains rounded hills some mountains,general assessment: rudimentary domestic: fixed-line subscribership about 1 per 100 persons; privatization of Malawi Telecommunications (MTL) a necessary step in bringing improvement to telecommunications services completed in 2006; mobile-cellular services are expanding but cellular network coverage is limited and is based around the main urban areas; mobile cellular subscribership roughly 8 per 100 persons international: country code - 265; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean 1 Atlantic Ocean),5.59,2009 est.,,,multiparty democracy,three equal horizontal bands of black (top) red and green with a radiant rising red sun centered in the black band,,$ 1 587 000 000,2008 est.,15451,2003,2.39,2009 est.,6.5,2008 est.,,,$ 11 560 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Peter W.

Agriculture employing more than one-quarter of the working population provides the economic base with major exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Black pearls are the Cook Islands' leading export. Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit processing clothing and handicrafts. Trade deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s the country lived beyond its means maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating a large foreign debt.

A succession of military governments ended in 1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles. A move to representative government began in 1989. Two years later free elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as president marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by elections held in 1996 and 2001 though some irregularities were alleged.

Between its initial unification in the 7th century - from three predecessor Korean states - until the 20th century Korea existed as a single independent country. In 1905 following the Russo-Japanese War Korea became a protectorate of imperial Japan and in 1910 it was annexed as a colony. Korea regained its independence following Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. After World War II a Republic of Korea (ROK) was set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was installed in the north (the DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53) US troops and UN forces fought alongside soldiers from the ROK to defend South Korea from DPRK attacks supported by China and the Soviet Union. An armistice was signed in 1953 splitting the peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter South Korea achieved rapid economic growth with per capita income rising to roughly 14 times the level of North Korea. In 1993 KIM Young-sam became South Korea's first civilian president following 32 years of military rule. South Korea today is a fully functioning modern democracy. In June 2000 a historic first North-South summit took place between the South's President KIM Dae-jung and the North's leader KIM Jong Il. In October 2007 a second North-South summit took place between the South's President ROH Moo-hyun and the North Korean leader.

Four decades ago GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. In 2004 South Korea joined the trillion dollar club of world economies. In 2008 its GDP per capita was roughly the same as that of the Czech Republic and New Zealand. Initially this success was achieved by a system of close government/business ties including directed credit import restrictions sponsorship of specific industries and a strong labor effort. The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods and encouraged savings and investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model including high debt/equity ratios massive foreign borrowing and an undisciplined financial sector. GDP plunged by 6.9% in 1998 then recovered by 9% in 1999-2000. Korea adopted numerous economic reforms following the crisis including greater openness to foreign investment and imports. Growth fell back to 3.3% in 2001 because of the slowing global economy falling exports and the perception that much-needed corporate and financial reforms had stalled. Led by consumer spending and exports growth in 2002 was an impressive 7% despite anemic global growth. Between 2003 and 2007 growth moderated to about 4-5% annually. A downturn in consumer spending was offset by rapid export growth. In 2008 inflation increased in the face of rising oil and food prices before easing in the fourth quarter. Korea was hit hard by the global financial turmoil that began in September 2008. Stock prices fell by more than 40% for the year and the value of the won fell by approximately 26%. Korean GDP shrank in the fourth quarter and GDP growth for the year was just 2.5%. The Korean government adopted several measures to combat the credit crunch and stimulate the economy.,43500000,2007,15 August 1945 (from Japan),0,2007 est.,34400000000,2007 est.,37000000000,2007 est.,1.3,1995 census,$ -6 349 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2008 est.,0.6,NA,$ 1 061 000 000 000,31 December 2007,,,10356604.0,2009 est.,Liberation Day 15 August (1945),812,2008,0.0,NA,occasional typhoons bring high winds and floods; low-level seismic activity common in southwest,slightly larger than Indiana,97.9,2002,78.72,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly or Kukhoe (299 seats; 243 members elected in single-seat constituencies 56 elected by proportional representation; to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 9 April 2008 (next to be held in April 2012) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - GNP 172 UDP 83 LFP 20 Pro-Park Alliance 8 DLP 5 CKP 1 independents 9,combines elements of continental European civil law systems Anglo-American law and Chinese classical thought; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB AfDB (nonregional member) APEC APT ARF ASEAN (dialogue partner) Australia Group BIS CP EAS EBRD FAO G-20 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IEA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAIA MIGA NEA NSG OAS (observer) OECD OPCW OSCE (partner) PCA PIF (partner) SAARC (observer) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNIFIL UNMIL UNMIS UNMOGIP UNOMIG UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO ZC,12.0,NA,13029859.0,2008 est.,2.7,2006,party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol Antarctic-Marine Living Resources Antarctic Treaty Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,air pollution in large cities; acid rain; water pollution from the discharge of sewage and industrial effluents; drift net fishing,2.0,2008,3.0,2008,440000000000,2008 est.,3381,2008,Inch'on P'ohang Pusan Ulsan,19.0,NA,2.2,2008 est.,mostly hills and mountains; wide coastal plains in west and south,general assessment: excellent domestic and international services featuring rapid incorporation of new technologies domestic: combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone subscribership roughly 140 per 100 persons; rapid assimilation of a full range of telecommunications technologies leading to a boom in e-commerce international: country code - 82; numerous submarine cables provide links throughout Asia Australia the Middle East Europe and US; satellite earth stations - 66,1.21,2009 est.,3.2,2008 est.,republic,white with a red (top) and blue yin-yang symbol in the center; there is a different black trigram from the ancient I Ching (Book of Changes) in each corner of the white field,,$ 427 400 000 000,2008 est.,103029,2008,0.27,2009 est.,2.5,2008 est.,536.0,2007,$ 1 278 000 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Kathleen STEPHENS embassy: 32 Sejongno Jongno-gu Seoul 110-710 mailing address: US Embassy Seoul APO AP 96205-5550 telephone: [82] (2) 397-4114 FAX: [82] (2) 738-8845,$ 26 000,2008 est.,640000000,2007 est.

Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee and sugar plantations and Havana became the launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement and occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed. US intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established Cuban independence from the US in 1902 after which the island experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military and corrupt politicians. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his iron rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly five decades. He stepped down as president in February 2008 in favor of his younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba's Communist revolution with Soviet support was exported throughout Latin America and Africa during the 1960s 1970s and 1980s. The country faced a severe economic downturn in 1990 following the withdrawal of former Soviet subsidies worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Cuba portrays its difficulties as the result of the US embargo in place since 1961.

It has rolled back limited reforms undertaken in the 1990s to increase enterprise efficiency and alleviate serious shortages of food consumer goods and services. The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level than before the downturn of the 1990s which was caused by the loss of Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. Since late 2000 Venezuela has been providing oil on preferential terms and it currently supplies about 100 000 barrels per day of petroleum products.

From the 16th to 19th centuries Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes; in 1852 it was transformed into a secular principality. After World War I Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929; at the conclusion of World War II it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the latter dissolved in 1992 Montenegro federated with Serbia first as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and after 2003 in a looser union of Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006 Montenegro invoked its right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to hold a referendum on independence from the state union.

The dissolution of the loose political union between Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 led to separate membership in several international financial institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. On 18 January 2007 Montenegro joined the World Bank and IMF. Montenegro is pursuing its own membership in the World Trade Organization and signed a Stabilization and Association agreement with the European Union in October 2007. On December 15 2008 Montenegro submitted an EU membership application. Unemployment and regional disparities in development are key political and economic problems. Montenegro has privatized its large aluminum complex - the dominant industry - as well as most of its financial sector and has begun to attract foreign direct investment in the tourism sector.

Following the 2005 harvest the government closed the sugar industry after decades of losses of 3-4% of GDP annually. To compensate for employment losses the government has embarked on a program to diversify the agricultural sector and to stimulate other sectors of the economy such as tourism export-oriented manufacturing and offshore banking. Economic growth was above average for Latin America from 2004 to 2006 but has since slowed. Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean the St. Kitts and Nevis is vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand.

Some basic foodstuffs must still be imported. Cocoa coffee and cotton generate about 40% of export earnings with cotton being the most important cash crop. Togo is the world's fourth-largest producer of phosphate. The government's decade-long effort supported by the World Bank and the IMF to implement economic reform measures encourage foreign investment and bring revenues in line with expenditures has moved slowly.

Reforms started in the late 1970s with the phasing out of collectivized agriculture and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices fiscal decentralization increased autonomy for state enterprises the foundation of a diversified banking system the development of stock markets the rapid growth of the non-state sector and the opening to foreign trade and investment. Annual inflows of foreign direct investment rose to nearly $84 billion in 2007. China has generally implemented reforms in a gradualist or piecemeal fashion. In recent years China has re-invigorated its support for leading state-owned enterprises in sectors it considers important to ""economic security "" explicitly looking to foster globally competitive national champions. After keeping its currency tightly linked to the US dollar for years China in July 2005 revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies. Cumulative appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar since the end of the dollar peg was more than 20% by late 2008 but the exchange rate has changed little since the onset of the global financial crisis. The restructuring of the economy and resulting efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in GDP since 1978. Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences China in 2008 stood as the second-largest economy in the world after the US although in per capita terms the country is still lower middle-income. The Chinese government faces numerous economic development challenges including: (a) strengthening its social safety net including pension and health system reform to counteract a high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low domestic demand; (b) sustaining adequate job growth for tens of millions of migrants new entrants to the work force and workers laid off from state-owned enterprises deemed not worth saving; (c) reducing corruption and other economic crimes; and (d) containing environmental damage and social strife related to the economy's rapid transformation. Economic development has been more rapid in coastal provinces than in the interior and approximately 200 million rural laborers and their dependents have relocated to urban areas to find work. One demographic consequence of the ""one child"" policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air pollution soil erosion and the steady fall of the water table especially in the north - is another long-term problem. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic development. In 2007 China intensified government efforts to improve environmental conditions tying the evaluation of local officials to environmental targets publishing a national climate change policy and establishing a high level leading group on climate change headed by Premier WEN Jiabao. The Chinese government seeks to add energy production capacity from sources other than coal and oil. In late 2008 as China commemorated the 30th anniversary of its historic economic reforms the global economic downturn began to slow foreign demand for Chinese exports for the first time in many years. The government vowed to continue reforming the economy and emphasized the need to increase domestic consumption in order to make China less dependent on foreign exports for GDP growth in the future.",547286000,2007,221 BC (unification under the Qin or Ch'in Dynasty);

Despite periods of autonomy over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman Byzantine Arab Persian and Ottoman. During World War I in the western portion of Armenia Ottoman Turkey instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in an estimated 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918 but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. Armenian leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh a primarily Armenian-populated region assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994 when a cease-fire took hold ethnic Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. Turkey closed the common border with Armenia because of the Armenian separatists' control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas.,15.6,2006 est.,pig iron unwrought copper nonferrous metals diamonds mineral products foodstuffs energy,17.52,31 December 2007,8.39,July 2009 est.,2233.0,2008,$ 12 070 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,11 provinces (marzer singular - marz); Aragatsotn Ararat Armavir Geghark'unik' Kotayk' Lorri Shirak Syunik' Tavush Vayots' Dzor Yerevan,10.5,1997,2.95,2000,fruit (especially grapes) vegetables; livestock,Armed Forces: Ground Forces Air Force and Air Defense Nagorno-Karabakh Self Defense Force (NKSDF) (2009),12.65,2009 est.,3.2,2001,$ 2 481 000 000,2008 est.,highland continental hot summers cold winters,natural gas petroleum tobacco products foodstuffs diamonds,"Armenian National Congress or ANC [Levon TER-PETROSSIAN]; Armenian National Movement or ANM [Ararat ZURABIAN]; Armenian People's Party [Tigran KARAPETIAN]; Armenian Ramkavar Azadagan Party Alliance or HRAK (includes former Dashink Party National Revival Party and Ramkavar Liberal Party); Armenian Revolutionary Federation (""Dashnak"" Party) or ARF [Hrant MARKARIAN]; Heritage Party [Raffi HOVHANNISIAN]; National Democratic Party [Shavarsh KOCHARIAN]; National Democratic Union or NDU [Vazgen MANUKIAN]; National Unity Party [Artashes GEGHAMIAN]; People's Party of Armenia [Stepan DEMIRCHIAN]; Prosperous Armenia [Gagik TSAROUKIAN]; Republic Party [Aram SARKISIAN]; Republican Party of Armenia or HHK [Serzh SARGSIAN]; Rule of Law Party (Orinats Yerkir) [Artur BAGHDASARIAN]; Union of Constitutional Rights [Hrant KHACHATURIAN]; United Labor Party [Gurgen ARSENIAN]",2967004,July 2009 est.,noun: Armenian(s) adjective: Armenian,small deposits of gold copper molybdenum zinc bauxite,-4.56,2009 est.,landlocked in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains; Sevana Lich (Lake Sevan) is the largest lake in this mountain range,Aylentrank (Impeachment) [Nikol PASHINIAN]; Yerkrapah Union [Manvel GRIGORIAN],Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 Armenia has made progress in implementing many economic reforms including privatization price reforms and prudent fiscal policies. The conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994 however the Armenian Government launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates. Economic growth has averaged over 10% in recent years. However with the global economic downturn Armenia's growth rate dropped to 7.6% in 2008. Armenia has managed to reduce poverty slash inflation stabilize its currency and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Under the old Soviet central planning system Armenia developed a modern industrial sector supplying machine tools textiles and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. Nuclear power plants built at Metsamor in the 1970s were closed following the 1988 Spitak Earthquake though they sustained no damage. One of the two reactors was re-opened in 1995 but the Armenian government is under international pressure to close it due to concerns that the Soviet era design lacks important safeguards. Metsamor provides 40 percent of the country's electricity - hydropower accounts for about one-fourth. Economic ties with Russia remain close especially in the energy sector. The electricity distribution system was privatized in 2002 and bought by Russia's RAO-UES in 2005. Construction of a pipeline to deliver natural gas from Iran to Armenia was completed in December 2008 and after testing is expected to be operational in Spring 2009 though it is unlikely significant quantities of gas will flow through it until the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant renovation is completed in 2010. Armenia has some mineral deposits (copper gold bauxite). Pig iron unwrought copper and other nonferrous metals are Armenia's highest valued exports. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid remittances from Armenians working abroad and foreign direct investment. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years but anti-corruption measures will be more difficult to implement. Despite strong economic growth Armenia's unemployment rate remains high. Armenia will need to pursue additional economic reforms in order to improve its economic competitiveness and to build on recent improvements in poverty and unemployment especially given its economic isolation from two of its nearest neighbors Turkey and Azerbaijan. The disruption of rail transit into Armenia during the Georgia-Russia conflict in August 2008 highlighted how vulnerable Armenia's supply chains for key goods - such as gasoline - are to instances of regional instability.,1185400,2006,21 September 1991 (from the Soviet Union),0,2007 est.,2050000000,2007 est.,2050000000,2007 est.,1.3,NA,$ -1 355 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,400600000.0,2007 est.,-0.3,NA,$ 1 256 000 000,31 December 2007,,,642734.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 21 September (1991),,,400.0,NA,occasionally severe earthquakes; droughts,slightly smaller than Maryland,99.4,2001 census,72.68,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly (Parliament) or Azgayin Zhoghov (131 seats; members elected by popular vote 90 members elected by party list and 41 by direct vote; to serve five-year terms) elections: last held 12 May 2007 (next to be held in the spring of 2012) election results: percent of vote by party - HHK 33.9% Prosperous Armenia 15.1% ARF (Dashnak) 13.2% Rule of Law 7.1% Heritage Party 6% other 24.7%; seats by party - HHK 64 Prosperous Armenia 18 ARF (Dashnak) 16 Rule of Law 9 Heritage Party 7 independent 17,based on civil law system; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACCT (observer) ADB BSEC CE CIS CSTO EAEC (observer) EAPC EBRD FAO GCTU IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU MIGA NAM (observer) OAS (observer) OIF (associate member) OPCW OSCE PFP UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,,,809576.0,2008 est.,6.5,FY01,party to: Air Pollution Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Wetlands signed but not ratified: Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants,soil pollution from toxic chemicals such as DDT; the energy crisis of the 1990s led to deforestation when citizens scavenged for firewood; pollution of Hrazdan (Razdan) and Aras Rivers; the draining of Sevana Lich (Lake Sevan) a result of its use as a source for hydropower threatens drinking water supplies; restart of Metsamor nuclear power plant in spite of its location in a seismically active zone,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,5544000000,2007 est.,845,2008,,18.0,NA,2.4,2008 est.,Armenian Highland with mountains; little forest land; fast flowing rivers; good soil in Aras River valley,general assessment: telecommunications investments have made major inroads in modernizing and upgrading the outdated telecommunications network inherited from the Soviet era; now 100% privately owned and undergoing modernization and expansion; mobile-cellular services monopoly terminated in late 2004 and a second provider began operations in mid-2005 domestic: reliable modern landline and mobile-cellular services are available across Yerevan in major cities and towns; significant but ever-shrinking gaps remain in mobile-cellular coverage in rural areas international: country code - 374; Yerevan is connected to the Trans-Asia-Europe fiber-optic cable through Iran; additional international service is available by microwave radio relay and landline connections to the other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States through the Moscow international switch and by satellite to the rest of the world; satellite earth stations - 3 (2007),1.36,2009 est.,7.1,2007 est.,republic,three equal horizontal bands of red (top) blue and orange; the color red recalls the blood shed for liberty blue the Armenian skies as well as hope and orange the land and the courage of the workers who farm it,illicit cultivation of small amount of cannabis for domestic consumption; minor transit point for illicit drugs - mostly opium and hashish - moving from Southwest Asia to Russia and to a lesser extent the rest of Europe,$ 3 763 000 000,2008 est.,7700,2006,-0.03,2009 est.,7.6,2008 est.,,,$ 18 920 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Marie L.

Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945 but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur (East Timor). An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades during which an estimated 100 000 to 250 000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999 in a UN-supervised popular referendum an overwhelming majority of the people of Timor-Leste voted for independence from Indonesia. Between the referendum and the arrival of a multinational peacekeeping force in late September 1999 anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and supported by the Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The militias killed approximately 1 400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300 000 people into western Timor as refugees. The majority of the country's infrastructure including homes irrigation systems water supply systems and schools and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20 September 1999 the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002 Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state. In late April 2006 internal tensions threatened the new nation's security when a military strike led to violence and a near breakdown of law and order in Dili. At the request of the Government of Timor-Leste an Australian-led International Stabilization Force (ISF) deployed to Timor-Leste in late May. In August the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) which included an authorized police presence of over 1 600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored stability allowing the Government of Timor-Leste to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in April and June 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February 2008 a rebel group staged an unsuccessful attack against the president and prime minister. The ringleader was killed in the attack and the majority of the rebels surrendered to the government in April 2008.,90.0,2006 est.,coffee sandalwood marble; note - potential for oil and vanilla exports,15.05,31 December 2007,5.98,July 2009 est.,,,$ 489 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,13 administrative districts; Aileu Ainaro Baucau Bobonaro (Maliana) Cova-Lima (Suai) Dili Ermera Lautem (Los Palos) Liquica Manatuto Manufahi (Same) Oecussi (Ambeno) Viqueque,,,,,coffee rice corn cassava sweet potatoes soybeans cabbage mangoes bananas vanilla,Timor-Leste Defense Force (Forcas de Defesa de Timor-L'este Falintil (F-FDTL)): Army Navy (Armada) (2009),26.25,2009 est.,,,$ 309 000 000,FY06/07 est.,tropical; hot humid; distinct rainy and dry seasons,food gasoline kerosene machinery,Democratic Party or PD [Fernando de ARAUJO]; National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction or CNRT [Xanana GUSMAO]; National Democratic Union of Timorese Resistance or UNDERTIM [Cornelio DA Conceicao GAMA]; National Unity Party or PUN [Fernanda BORGES]; People's Party of Timor or PPT [Jacob XAVIER]; Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste or FRETILIN [Mari ALKATIRI]; Social Democratic Association of Timor or ASDT [Francisco Xavier do AMARAL]; Social Democratic Party or PSD [Zacarias Albano da COSTA]; Sons of the Mountain Warriors or KOTA [Manuel TILMAN] (also known as Association of Timorese Heroes),1131612,July 2009 est.,noun: Timorese adjective: Timorese,gold petroleum natural gas manganese marble,,,"Timor comes from the Malay word for ""East""; the island of Timor is part of the Malay Archipelago and is the largest and easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands",NA,In late 1999 about 70% of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was laid waste by Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias. Three hundred thousand people fled westward. Over the next three years a massive international program manned by 5 000 peacekeepers (8 000 at peak) and 1 300 police officers led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas. By the end of 2005 refugees had returned or had settled in Indonesia. The country continues to face great challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure strengthening the civil administration and generating jobs for young people entering the work force. The development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has begun to supplement government revenues ahead of schedule and above expectations. The technology-intensive industry however has done little to create jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities in Timor. Gas is piped to Australia. In June 2005 the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and preserve the value of Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth for future generations. The Fund held assets of US$3.9 billion as of October 2008. The economy is recovering from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence and civil unrest which disrupted both private and public sector economic activity. The government in 2008 resettled tens of thousands of an estimated 100 000 internally displaced persons.

In 1697 Spain recognized French dominion over the western third of the island which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island by then known as Santo Domingo sought to gain its own independence in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861 the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865. A legacy of unsettled mostly non-representative rule followed capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930-61. Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. In 1965 the United States led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 1966 Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an election to become president. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the presidency.

The global recession however had a significant impact on GDP growth in the latter half of the year as tourism and remittances two of the Dominican Republic's most important economic contributors showed signs of slowing. The economy is highly dependent upon the US the destination for about two-thirds of exports. Remittances from the US amount to about a tenth of GDP equivalent to almost half of exports and three-quarters of tourism receipts. The country has long been viewed primarily as an exporter of sugar coffee and tobacco but in recent years the service sector has overtaken agriculture as the economy's largest employer due to growth in tourism and free trade zones. Although 2007 saw inflation around 6% the rate grew to over 12% in 2008. High food prices driven by the effects of consecutive tropical storms on agricultural products and education prices were significant contributors to the jump. The effects of the global financial crisis and the US recession are projected to negatively affect GDP growth in 2009 with a rebound expected in 2010. Although the economy is growing at a respectable rate high unemployment and underemployment remains an important challenge. The country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half of the population receives less than one-fifth of GNP while the richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of national income. The Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into force in March 2007 which should boost investment and exports and reduce losses to the Asian garment industry.,5513000,2007,27 February 1844 (from Haiti),0,2007 est.,239800000,2005,250000000,2006 est.,5.0,NA,$ -4 422 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,2.6,NA,$ 15 920 000 000,31 December 2007,,,1921836.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 27 February (1844),1,2008,-46.0,NA,lies in the middle of the hurricane belt and subject to severe storms from June to October; occasional flooding; periodic droughts,slightly more than twice the size of New Hampshire,87.0,2002 census,73.7,2009 est.,bicameral National Congress or Congreso Nacional consists of the Senate or Senado (32 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) and the House of Representatives or Camara de Diputados (178 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: Senate - last held 16 May 2006 (next to be held in May 2010); House of Representatives - last held 16 May 2006 (next to be held in May 2010) election results: Senate - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PLD 22 PRD 6 PRSC 4; House of Representatives - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PLD 96 PRD 60 PRSC 22,based on French civil codes; Criminal Procedures Code modified in 2004 to include important elements of an accusatory system; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP BCIE Caricom (observer) FAO G-77 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO (suspended) ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU ITUC LAES LAIA (observer) MIGA NAM OAS OPANAL OPCW (signatory) PCA RG SICA (associated member) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO Union Latina UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,6.0,NA,2326694.0,2008 est.,0.8,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Marine Dumping Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: Law of the Sea,water shortages; soil eroding into the sea damages coral reefs; deforestation,2.0,2008,1.0,2008,13370000000,2006 est.,1784,2008,Boca Chica Caucedo Puerto Plata Rio Haina Santo Domingo,18.0,NA,1.3,2008 est.,rugged highlands and mountains with fertile valleys interspersed,general assessment: relatively efficient system based on island-wide microwave radio relay network domestic: fixed telephone line density is about 10 per 100 persons; multiple providers of mobile cellular service with a subscribership of roughly 60 per 100 persons international: country code - 1-809; landing point for the Americas Region Caribbean Ring System (ARCOS-1) fiber-optic telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to South and Central America parts of the Caribbean and US; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2007),2.76,2009 est.,15.5,2008 est.,democratic republic,a centered white cross that extends to the edges divides the flag into four rectangles - the top ones are blue (hoist side) and red and the bottom ones are red (hoist side) and blue; a small coat of arms featuring a shield supported by an olive branch (left) and a palm branch (right) is at the center of the cross; above the shield a blue ribbon displays the motto DIOS PATRIA LIBERTAD (God Fatherland Liberty) and below the shield REPUBLICA DOMINICANA appears on a red ribbon,transshipment point for South American drugs destined for the US and Europe; has become a transshipment point for ecstasy from the Netherlands and Belgium destined for US and Canada; substantial money laundering activity in particular by Colombian narcotics traffickers; significant amphetamine consumption (2008),$ 16 080 000 000,2008 est.,19705,2002,1.49,2009 est.,4.5,2008 est.,,,$ 77 430 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador P.

Weakened by internecine quarrels and Mongol invasions Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid the foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent centuries. A new Ukrainian state the Cossack Hetmanate was established during the mid-17th century after an uprising against the Poles. Despite continuous Muscovite pressure the Hetmanate managed to remain autonomous for well over 100 years. During the latter part of the 18th century most Ukrainian ethnographic territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire. Following the collapse of czarist Russia in 1917 Ukraine was able to bring about a short-lived period of independence (1917-20) but was reconquered and forced to endure a brutal Soviet rule that engineered two artificial famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II German and Soviet armies were responsible for some 7 to 8 million more deaths. Although final independence for Ukraine was achieved in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR democracy remained elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic corruption stalled efforts at economic reform privatization and civil liberties. A peaceful mass protest ""Orange Revolution"" in the closing months of 2004 forced the authorities to overturn a rigged presidential election and to allow a new internationally monitored vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent internal squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp allowed his rival Viktor YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in parliamentary elections and become prime minister in August of 2006. An early legislative election brought on by a political crisis in the spring of 2007 saw Yuliya TYMOSHENKO as head of an ""Orange"" coalition installed as a new prime minister in December 2007.",19.4,2005,ferrous and nonferrous metals fuel and petroleum products chemicals machinery and transport equipment food products,11.33,31 December 2007,15.81,July 2009 est.,4211.0,2008,$ 198 000 000 000,2008 est.,$ 41 770 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,$ 1 905 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,24 provinces (oblasti singular - oblast') 1 autonomous republic* (avtonomna respublika) and 2 municipalities (mista singular - misto) with oblast status**; Cherkasy Chernihiv Chernivtsi Crimea or Avtonomna Respublika Krym* (Simferopol') Dnipropetrovs'k Donets'k Ivano-Frankivs'k Kharkiv Kherson Khmel'nyts'kyy Kirovohrad Kyiv** Kyiv Luhans'k L'viv Mykolayiv Odesa Poltava Rivne Sevastopol'** Sumy Ternopil' Vinnytsya Volyn' (Luts'k) Zakarpattya (Uzhhorod) Zaporizhzhya Zhytomyr note: administrative divisions have the same names as their administrative centers (exceptions have the administrative center name following in parentheses),139.5,1997,37.53,2000,grain sugar beets sunflower seeds vegetables; beef milk,Ground Forces Naval Forces Air and Air Defense Forces (Viyskovo-Povitryani Syly VPS) (2009),9.6,2009 est.,6.3,2006,$ 56 550 000 000,2008 est.,temperate continental; Mediterranean only on the southern Crimean coast; precipitation disproportionately distributed highest in west and north lesser in east and southeast; winters vary from cool along the Black Sea to cold farther inland; summers are warm across the greater part of the country hot in the south,energy machinery and equipment chemicals,Christian Democratic Union [Volodymyr STRETOVYCH]; Communist Party of Ukraine or CPU [Petro SYMONENKO]; European Party of Ukraine [Mykola KATERYNCHUK]; Fatherland Party (Batkivshchyna) [Yuliya TYMOSHENKO]; Forward Ukraine!

Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat milk grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise its diversified heavy industry supplied the unique equipment (for example large diameter pipes) and raw materials to industrial and mining sites (vertical drilling apparatus) in other regions of the former USSR. Shortly after independence was ratified in December 1991 the Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for privatization but widespread resistance to reform within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking. Output by 1999 had fallen to less than 40% of the 1991 level. Ukraine's dependence on Russia for energy supplies and the lack of significant structural reform have made the Ukrainian economy vulnerable to external shocks. Ukraine depends on imports to meet about three-fourths of its annual oil and natural gas requirements. Ukraine concluded a deal with Russia in January 2006 that almost doubled the price Ukraine pays for Russian gas. Disputes with Russia over pricing have led to periodic gas cut-offs. Outside institutions - particularly the IMF - have encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of reforms. Ukrainian Government officials eliminated most tax and customs privileges in a March 2005 budget law bringing more economic activity out of Ukraine's large shadow economy but more improvements are needed including fighting corruption developing capital markets and improving the legislative framework. Ukraine's economy was buoyant despite political turmoil between the prime minister and president until mid-2008. Real GDP growth reached roughly 7% in 2006-07 fueled by high global prices for steel - Ukraine's top export - and by strong domestic consumption spurred by rising pensions and wages. The drop in steel prices and Ukraine's exposure to the global financial crisis due to aggressive foreign borrowing has lowered growth in 2008 and the economy probably will contract in 2009. Ukraine reached an agreement with the IMF for a $16.5 billion standby arrangement in November 2008 to deal with the economic crisis.

In order to secure these holdings it entered into a series of treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in 1971. Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. Facing declining oil reserves Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has transformed itself into an international banking center. King HAMAD bin Isa al-Khalifa after coming to power in 1999 pushed economic and political reforms to improve relations with the Shia community. Shia political societies participated in 2006 parliamentary and municipal elections. Al Wifaq the largest Shia political society won the largest number of seats in the elected chamber of the legislature. However Shia discontent has resurfaced in recent years with street demonstrations and occasional low-level violence.,1.0,1997 est.,petroleum and petroleum products aluminum textiles,8.35,31 December 2007,4.37,July 2009 est.,20.0,2008,$ 19 680 000 000,2008 est.,$ 15 010 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,$ 9 520 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,5 governorates; Asamah Janubiyah Muharraq Shamaliyah Wasat note: each governorate administered by an appointed governor,0.1,1997,0.3,2000,fruit vegetables; poultry dairy products; shrimp fish,Bahrain Defense Forces (BDF): Ground Force (includes Air Defense) Naval Force Air Force National Guard,17.02,2009 est.,3.9,1991,$ 5 612 000 000,2008 est.,arid; mild pleasant winters; very hot humid summers,crude oil machinery chemicals,political parties prohibited but political societies were legalized per a July 2005 law,727785,July 2009 est.,noun: Bahraini(s) adjective: Bahraini,oil associated and nonassociated natural gas fish pearls,0.2,2009 est.,close to primary Middle Eastern petroleum sources; strategic location in Persian Gulf through which much of the Western world's petroleum must transit to reach open ocean,Shia activists; Sunni Islamist legislators other: several small leftist and other groups are active,With its highly developed communication and transport facilities Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms with business in the Gulf. Petroleum production and refining account for over 60% of Bahrain's export receipts over 70% of government revenues and 11% of GDP (exclusive of allied industries) underpinning Bahrain's strong economic growth in recent years. Aluminum is Bahrain's second major export after oil. Other major segments of Bahrain's economy are the financial and construction sectors. Bahrain is focused on Islamic banking and is competing on an international scale with Malaysia as a worldwide banking center. Bahrain is actively pursuing the diversification and privatization of its economy to reduce the country's dependence on oil. As part of this effort in August 2006 Bahrain and the US implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state. Continued strong growth hinges on Bahrain's ability to acquire new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries. Unemployment especially among the young and the depletion of oil and underground water resources are long-term economic problems. The global financial crisis is likely to result in slower economic growth for Bahrain during 2009 as tight international credit and a slowing global economy cause funding for many non-oil projects to dry up. Lower oil prices may also cause Bahrain's budget to slip back into deficit.,1116000,2007,15 August 1971 (from the UK),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,11330000000,2006 est.,9.0,2001 census,$ 2 255 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,1.8,NA,$ 10 320 000 000,31 December 2007,,,144555.0,2009 est.,National Day 16 December (1971); note - 15 August 1971 was the date of independence from the UK 16 December 1971 was the date of independence from British protection,9,2008,0.0,NA,periodic droughts; dust storms,3.5 times the size of Washington DC,86.5,2001 census,75.16,2009 est.,bicameral legislature consists of the Consultative Council (40 members appointed by the King) and the Council of Representatives or Chamber of Deputies (40 seats; members directly elected to serve four-year terms) elections: Council of Representatives - last held November-December 2006 (next election to be held in 2010) election results: Council of Representatives - percent of vote by society - NA; seats by society - al Wifaq (Shia) 17 al Asala (Sunni Salafi) 5 al Minbar (Sunni Muslim Brotherhood) 7 independents 11; note - seats by society as of February 2007 - al Wifaq 17 al Asala 8 al Minbar 7 al Mustaqbal (Moderate Sunni pro-government) 4 unassociated independents (all Sunni) 3 independent affiliated with al Wifaq (Sunni oppositionist) 1,based on Islamic law and English common law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ABEDA AFESD AMF FAO G-77 GCC IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IDB IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM (observer) IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAS MIGA NAM OAPEC OIC OPCW PCA UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,170471.0,2008 est.,4.5,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,desertification resulting from the degradation of limited arable land periods of drought and dust storms; coastal degradation (damage to coastlines coral reefs and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers oil refineries and distribution stations; lack of freshwater resources (groundwater and seawater are the only sources for all water needs),,,1.0,2008,9233000000,2006 est.,,,Mina' Salman Sitrah,20.0,NA,6.3,2008 est.,mostly low desert plain rising gently to low central escarpment,general assessment: modern system domestic: modern fiber-optic integrated services; digital network with rapidly growing use of mobile-cellular telephones international: country code - 973; landing point for the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) submarine cable network that provides links to Asia Middle East Europe and US; tropospheric scatter to Qatar and UAE; microwave radio relay to Saudi Arabia; satellite earth station - 1 (2007),2.5,2009 est.,15.0,2005 est.,constitutional monarchy,red the traditional color for flags of Persian Gulf states with a white serrated band (five white points) on the hoist side; the five points represent the five pillars of Islam,,$ 14 250 000 000,2008 est.,3498,2003,1.29,2009 est.,6.1,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 26 700 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador J.

Its key economic sector is manufacturing - principally the wood metals engineering telecommunications and electronics industries. Trade is important; Finland's ratio of exports to GDP has risen from a quarter to 37% over the past 15 years. Finland excels in high-tech exports such as mobile phones. Except for timber and several minerals Finland depends on imports of raw materials energy and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry an important export earner provides a secondary occupation for the rural population. Although Finland has been one of the best performing economies within the EU in recent years and its banks and financial markets have avoided the worst of global financial crisis the world slowdown has hit export growth and domestic demand and will serve as a brake on economic growth in 2009 and 2010. The slowdown of construction other investment and exports will cause unemployment to rise. During 2009 unemployment will climb to over 8% of the labor force. Long-term challenges include the need to address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity that threaten competitiveness fiscal sustainability and economic growth.,6080000,2007,6 December 1917 (from Russia),0,2007 est.,4576000000,2007 est.,2268000000,2007 est.,0.1,2006,$ 5 518 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,16000000000.0,2008,0.8,NA,$ 225 400 000 000,31 December 2007,,,920297.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 6 December (1917),98,2008,0.0,NA,NA,slightly smaller than Montana,100.0,2000 est.,78.97,2009 est.,unicameral Parliament or Eduskunta (200 seats; members are elected by popular vote on a proportional basis to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 18 March 2007 (next to be held March 2011) election results: percent of vote by party - Kesk 23.1% Kok 22.3% SDP 21.4% VAS 8.8% VIHR 8.5% KD 4.9% SFP 4.5% True Finns 4.1% other 3.4%; seats by party - Kesk 51 Kok 50 SDP 45 VAS 17 VIHR 15 SFP 9 KD 7 True Finns 5 other 1,civil law system based on Swedish law; the president may request the Supreme Court to review laws; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,ADB (nonregional member) AfDB (nonregional member) Arctic Council Australia Group BIS CBSS CE CERN EAPC EBRD EIB EMU ESA EU FAO G-9 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IEA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA NAM (guest) NC NEA NIB NSG OAS (observer) OECD OPCW OSCE Paris Club PCA PFP Schengen Convention UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNMIL UNMIS UNMOGIP UNTSO UPU WCO WEU (observer) WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO ZC,12.0,NA,1121187.0,2008 est.,2.0,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants Air Pollution-Sulfur 85 Air Pollution-Sulfur 94 Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds Antarctic-Environmental Protocol Antarctic-Marine Living Resources Antarctic Treaty Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,air pollution from manufacturing and power plants contributing to acid rain; water pollution from industrial wastes agricultural chemicals; habitat loss threatens wildlife populations,3.0,2008,3.0,2008,74100000000,2008,5794,2008,Hamina Helsinki Kokkola Kotka Naantali Pori Raahe Rauma Turku,18.0,NA,0.4,2008 est.,mostly low flat to rolling plains interspersed with lakes and low hills,general assessment: modern system with excellent service domestic: digital fiber-optic fixed-line network and an extensive cellular network provide domestic needs international: country code - 358; submarine cables provide links to Estonia and Sweden; satellite earth stations - access to Intelsat transmission service via a Swedish satellite earth station 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note - Finland shares the Inmarsat earth station with the other Nordic countries (Denmark Iceland Norway and Sweden),1.73,2009 est.,6.4,2008 est.,republic,white with a blue cross extending to the edges of the flag; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side in the style of the Dannebrog (Danish flag),,$ 87 510 000 000,2008 est.,78141,2009,0.1,2009 est.,1.5,2008 est.,,,$ 195 200 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Barbara BARRETT embassy: Itainen Puistotie 14B 00140 Helsinki mailing address: APO AE 09723 telephone: [358] (9) 616250 FAX: [358] (9) 6162 5800,$ 37 200,2008 est.,0,2007 est.

Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup Col. Muammar Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI began to espouse his own political system the Third Universal Theory. The system is a combination of socialism and Islam derived in part from tribal practices and is supposed to be implemented by the Libyan people themselves in a unique form of ""direct democracy."" QADHAFI has always seen himself as a revolutionary and visionary leader. He used oil funds during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of Marxism and capitalism. In addition beginning in 1973 he engaged in military operations in northern Chad's Aozou Strip - to gain access to minerals and to use as a base of influence in Chadian politics - but was forced to retreat in 1987. UN sanctions in 1992 isolated QADHAFI politically following the downing of Pan AM Flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland. During the 1990s QADHAFI began to rebuild his relationships with Europe. UN sanctions were suspended in April 1999 and finally lifted in September 2003 after Libya accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing. In December 2003 Libya announced that it had agreed to reveal and end its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction and to renounce terrorism. QADHAFI has made significant strides in normalizing relations with Western nations since then. He has received various Western European leaders as well as many working-level and commercial delegations and made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he traveled to Brussels in April 2004. The US rescinded Libya's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in June 2006. In January 2008 Libya assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2008-09 term. In August 2008 the US and Libya signed a bilateral comprehensive claims settlement agreement to compensate claimants in both countries who allege injury or death at the hands of the other country including the Lockerbie bombing the LaBelle disco bombing and the UTA 772 bombing. In October 2008 the US Government received $1.5 billion pursuant to the agreement to distribute to US national claimants and as a result effectively normalized its bilateral relationship with Libya.

The expected weakness in world hydrocarbon prices throughout 2009 will reduce Libyan government tax income and constrain Libyan economic growth in 2009. Substantial revenues from the energy sector coupled with a small population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in Africa but little of this income flows down to the lower orders of society. Libyan officials in the past five years have made progress on economic reforms as part of a broader campaign to reintegrate the country into the international fold. This effort picked up steam after UN sanctions were lifted in September 2003 and as Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon programs to build weapons of mass destruction. UN Sanctions against Libya were lifted in September 2003. The process of lifting US unilateral sanctions began in the spring of 2004; all sanctions were removed by June 2006 helping Libya attract greater foreign direct investment especially in the energy sector. Libyan oil and gas licensing rounds continue to draw high international interest; the National Oil Company set a goal of nearly doubling oil production to 3 million bbl/day by 2012. Libya faces a long road ahead in liberalizing the socialist-oriented economy but initial steps - including applying for WTO membership reducing some subsidies and announcing plans for privatization - are laying the groundwork for a transition to a more market-based economy. The non-oil manufacturing and construction sectors which account for more than 20% of GDP have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals iron steel and aluminum. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit agricultural output and Libya imports about 75% of its food. Libya's primary agricultural water source remains the Great Manmade River Project but significant resources are being invested in desalinization research to meet growing water demands.,4500000,2007,24 December 1951 (from UN trusteeship),9900000000,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,6390000000,2006 est.,3.0,NA,$ 32 780 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,2.2,NA,,,2004,,1409684.0,2009 est.,Revolution Day 1 September (1969),17,2008,-47.0,NA,hot dry dust-laden ghibli is a southern wind lasting one to four days in spring and fall; dust storms sandstorms,slightly larger than Alaska,82.6,2003 est.,77.26,2009 est.,unicameral General People's Congress (760 seats; members elected indirectly through a hierarchy of people's committees),based on Italian and French civil law systems and Islamic law; separate religious courts; no constitutional provision for judicial review of legislative acts; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ABEDA AfDB AFESD AMF AMU AU CAEU COMESA FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU LAS MIGA NAM OAPEC OIC OPCW OPEC PCA UN UNAMID UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO (observer),12.0,NA,1611001.0,2008 est.,3.9,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: Law of the Sea,desertification; limited natural fresh water resources; the Great Manmade River Project the largest water development scheme in the world is being built to bring water from large aquifers under the Sahara to coastal cities,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,23980000000,2007 est.,,,As Sidrah Az Zuwaytinah Marsa al Burayqah Ra's Lanuf Tripoli Zawiyah,18.0,NA,6.2,2008 est.,mostly barren flat to undulating plains plateaus depressions,general assessment: telecommunications system is state-owned and service is poor but investment is being made to upgrade; state retains monopoly in fixed-line services; mobile cellular telephone system became operational in 1996; multiple providers for a mobile telephone system that is growing rapidly; combined fixed line and mobile telephone density approached 90 telephones per 100 persons in 2007 domestic: microwave radio relay coaxial cable cellular tropospheric scatter and a domestic satellite system with 14 earth stations international: country code - 218; satellite earth stations - 4 Intelsat NA Arabsat and NA Intersputnik; submarine cables to France and Italy; microwave radio relay to Tunisia and Egypt; tropospheric scatter to Greece; participant in Medarabtel (2007),3.08,2009 est.,30.0,2004 est.,Jamahiriya (a state of the masses) in theory governed by the populace through local councils; in practice an authoritarian state,plain green; green is the traditional color of Islam (the state religion),,$ 25 310 000 000,2008 est.,100024,2003,2.17,2009 est.,6.3,2008 est.,2.0,2007,$ 88 860 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Gene A.

Indonesia's debt-to-GDP ratio in recent years has declined steadily because of increasingly robust GDP growth and sound fiscal stewardship. The government has introduced significant reforms in the financial sector including in the areas of tax and customs the use of Treasury bills and capital market supervision. Indonesia's investment law passed in March 2007 seeks to address some of the concerns of foreign and domestic investors. Indonesia still struggles with poverty and unemployment inadequate infrastructure corruption a complex regulatory environment and unequal resource distribution among regions. The non-bank financial sector including pension funds and insurance remains weak and despite efforts to broaden and deepen capital markets they remain underdeveloped. Economic difficulties in early 2008 centered on high global food and oil prices and their impact on Indonesia's poor and on the budget. The onset of the global financial crisis dampened inflationary pressures but increased risk aversion for emerging market assets resulted in large losses in the stock market significant depreciation of the rupiah and a difficult environment for bond issuance. As global demand has slowed and prices for Indonesia's commodity exports have fallen Indonesia faces the prospect of growth significantly below the 6-plus percent recorded in 2007 and 2008.,81835000,2007,17 August 1945 (declared); 27 December 1949 (by the Netherlands) note: in August 2005 the Netherlands announced it recognized de facto Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945,32600000000,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,23400000000,2007 est.,1.8,2000 census,$ 604 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,3.3,NA,$ 170 200 000 000,31 December 2007,,,52503046.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 17 August (1945),971,2008,0.0,NA,occasional floods; severe droughts; tsunamis; earthquakes; volcanoes; forest fires,slightly less than three times the size of Texas,90.4,2004 est.,70.76,2009 est.,People's Consultative Assembly (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat or MPR) is the upper house consists of members of DPR and DPD has role in inaugurating and impeaching the president and in amending the constitution does not formulate national policy; House of Representatives or Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (DPR) (550 seats members elected to serve five-year terms) formulates and passes legislation at the national level; House of Regional Representatives (Dewan Perwakilan Daerah or DPD) constitutionally mandated role includes providing legislative input to DPR on issues affecting regions elections: last held 9 April 2009 (next to be held in 2014) election results: percent of vote by party - PD 20.9% GOLKAR 14.5% PDI-P 14.0% PKS 7.9% PAN 6.0% PPP 5.3% PKB 4.9% GERINDRA 4.5% HANURA 3.8% others 18.2%; seats by party - PD 148 GOLKAR 108 PDI-P 93 PKS 59 PAN 42 PPP 39 PKB 26 GERINDRA 30 HANURA 15 note: 29 other parties received less than 2.5% of the vote so did not obtain any seats; because of election rules the number of seats won does not always follow the percentage of votes received by parties,based on Roman-Dutch law substantially modified by indigenous concepts and by new criminal procedures and election codes; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB APEC APT ARF ASEAN BIS CP EAS FAO G-15 G-20 G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM (observer) IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MONUC NAM OIC OPCW OPEC PIF (partner) UN UNAMID UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNIFIL UNMIL UNMIS UNOMIG UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,61729717.0,2008 est.,3.0,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands signed but not ratified: Marine Life Conservation,deforestation; water pollution from industrial wastes sewage; air pollution in urban areas; smoke and haze from forest fires,5.0,2008,4.0,2008,142400000000,2007 est.,8529,2008,Banjarmasin Belawan Ciwandan Kotabaru Krueg Geukueh Palembang Panjang Sungai Pakning Tanjung Perak Tanjung Priok,17.0,NA,3.7,2008 est.,mostly coastal lowlands; larger islands have interior mountains,general assessment: domestic service fair international service good domestic: interisland microwave system and HF radio police net; domestic satellite communications system; coverage provided by existing network has been expanded by use of over 200 000 telephone kiosks many located in remote areas; mobile cellular subscribership growing rapidly international: country code - 62; landing point for both the SEA-ME-WE-3 and SEA-ME-WE-4 submarine cable networks that provide links throughout Asia the Middle East and Europe; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean and 1 Pacific Ocean),2.31,2009 est.,8.4,2008 est.,republic,two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and white; similar to the flag of Monaco which is shorter; also similar to the flag of Poland which is white (top) and red,illicit producer of cannabis largely for domestic use; producer of methamphetamine and ecstasy,$ 116 000 000 000,2008 est.,391009,2005,1.14,2009 est.,6.1,2008 est.,17.0,2007,$ 915 900 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Cameron R.

After three tumultuous decades of misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was established in 1993 and lasted for one decade. President Ange-Felix PATASSE's civilian government was plagued by unrest and in March 2003 he was deposed in a military coup led by General Francois BOZIZE who established a transitional government. Though the government has the tacit support of civil society groups and the main parties a wide field of candidates contested the municipal legislative and presidential elections held in March and May of 2005 in which General BOZIZE was affirmed as president. The government still does not fully control the countryside where pockets of lawlessness persist.

During the 19th and 20th centuries 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65) in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states and the Great Depression of the 1930s an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs.

In this market-oriented economy private individuals and business firms make most of the decisions and the federal and state governments buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant to lay off surplus workers and to develop new products. At the same time they face higher barriers to enter their rivals' home markets than foreign firms face entering US markets. US firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances especially in computers and in medical aerospace and military equipment; their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of a ""two-tier labor market"" in which those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and more and more fail to get comparable pay raises health insurance coverage and other benefits. Since 1975 practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households. The war in March-April 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq and the subsequent occupation of Iraq required major shifts in national resources to the military. Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage in the Gulf Coast region in August 2005 but had a small impact on overall GDP growth for the year. Soaring oil prices between 2005 and the first half of 2008 threatened inflation and unemployment as higher gasoline prices ate into consumers' budgets. Imported oil accounts for about two-thirds of US consumption. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population sizable trade and budget deficits and stagnation of family income in the lower economic groups. The merchandise trade deficit reached a record $847 billion in 2007 but declined to $810 billion in 2008 as a depreciating exchange rate for the dollar against most major currencies discouraged US imports and made US exports more competitive abroad. The global economic downturn the sub-prime mortgage crisis investment bank failures falling home prices and tight credit pushed the United States into a recession by mid-2008. To help stabilize financial markets the US Congress established a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October 2008. The government used some of these funds to purchase equity in US banks and other industrial corporations. In January 2009 the US Congress passed and President Barack OBAMA signed a bill providing an additional $787 billion fiscal stimulus - two-thirds on additional spending and one-third on tax cuts - to create jobs and to help the economy recover.",255000000,2007,4 July 1776 (from Great Britain),23280000000,2007 est.,130300000000,2007 est.,652900000000,2007 est.,0.6,2007 est.,$ -673 300 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,51400000000.0,2007 est.,1.3,NA,$ 14 210 000 000 000,31 December 2007,,,59437663.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 4 July (1776),422,2008,-86.0,NA,tsunamis;

An armed neutrality was preserved in both World Wars. Sweden's long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system interlarded with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by high unemployment and in 2000-02 by the global economic downturn but fiscal discipline over the past several years has allowed the country to weather economic vagaries.

It has a modern distribution system excellent internal and external communications and a skilled labor force. In September 2003 Swedish voters turned down entry into the euro system concerned about the impact on the economy and sovereignty. Timber hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for about 90% of industrial output of which the engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for only 1% of GDP and of employment. Until 2008 Sweden was in the midst of a sustained economic upswing boosted by increased domestic demand and strong exports. This and robust finances offered the center-right government considerable scope to implement its reform program aimed at increasing employment reducing welfare dependence and streamlining the state's role in the economy. Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals the Swedish economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and growth continued downward in the fourth as deteriorating global conditions reduced export demand and consumption.

It became part of French Indochina in 1887. Vietnam declared independence after World War II but France continued to rule until its 1954 defeat by Communist forces under Ho Chi MINH. Under the Geneva Accords of 1954 Vietnam was divided into the Communist North and anti-Communist South. US economic and military aid to South Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the government but US armed forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later North Vietnamese forces overran the South reuniting the country under Communist rule. Despite the return of peace for over a decade the country experienced little economic growth because of conservative leadership policies the persecution and mass exodus of individuals - many of them successful South Vietnamese merchants - and growing international isolation. However since the enactment of Vietnam's ""doi moi"" (renovation) policy in 1986 Vietnamese authorities have committed to increased economic liberalization and enacted structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce more competitive export-driven industries. The country continues to experience small-scale protests from various groups the vast majority connected to land-use issues and the lack of equitable mechanisms for resolving disputes. Various ethnic minorities such as the Montagnards of the Central Highlands and the Khmer Krom in the southern delta region have also held protests.

Since 2001 Vietnamese authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to economic liberalization and international integration. They have moved to implement the structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce more competitive export-driven industries. Vietnam's membership in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and entry into force of the US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement in December 2001 have led to even more rapid changes in Vietnam's trade and economic regime. Vietnam's exports to the US increased 900% from 2001 to 2007. Vietnam joined the WTO in January 2007 following over a decade long negotiation process. WTO membership has provided Vietnam an anchor to the global market and reinforced the domestic economic reform process. Among other benefits accession allows Vietnam to take advantage of the phase-out of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing which eliminated quotas on textiles and clothing for WTO partners on 1 January 2005. Agriculture's share of economic output has continued to shrink from about 25% in 2000 to less than 20% in 2008. Deep poverty has declined significantly and is now smaller than that of China India and the Philippines. Vietnam is working to create jobs to meet the challenge of a labor force that is growing by more than one-and-a-half million people every year. The global financial crisis however will constrain Vietnam's ability to create jobs and further reduce poverty. As global growth sharply drops in 2009 Vietnam's export-oriented economy - exports were 68% of GDP in 2007 - will suffer from lower exports higher unemployment and corporate bankruptcies and decreased foreign investment. Real GDP growth for 2009 could fall between 4% and 5%.

An estimated 820 000 tourists mainly from the US visited the islands in 2005. In the mid-1980s the government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues. Roughly 400 000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 2000. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994 which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses made the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to international business.

Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily dependent on foreign aid and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for gold and cotton its main exports. The government has continued its successful implementation of an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program that is helping the economy grow diversify and attract foreign investment. Mali has invested in tourism and a tractor assembly factory. Mali's adherence to economic reform and the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a 5% average in 1996-2008.

In the early 17th century a new Romanov Dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific. Under PETER I (ruled 1682-1725) hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th century more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 contributed to the Revolution of 1905 which resulted in the formation of a parliament and other reforms. Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial household. The Communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the USSR. The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN (1928-53) strengthened Communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. The Soviet economy and society stagnated in the following decades until General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize Communism but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent republics. Since then Russia has shifted its post-Soviet democratic ambitions in favor of a centralized semi-authoritarian state whose legitimacy is buttressed in part by carefully managed national elections former President PUTIN's genuine popularity and the prudent management of Russia's windfall energy wealth.

Over the last six years fixed capital investment growth and personal income growth have averaged above 10% but both grew at slower rates in 2008. Growth in 2008 was driven largely by non-tradable services and domestic manufacturing rather than exports. During the past decade poverty and unemployment declined steadily and the middle class continued to expand. Russia also improved its international financial position running balance of payments surpluses since 2000. Foreign exchange reserves grew from $12 billion in 1999 to almost $600 billion by end July 2008 which include $200 billion in two sovereign wealth funds: a reserve fund to support budgetary expenditures in case of a fall in the price of oil and a national welfare fund to help fund pensions and infrastructure development. Total foreign debt is almost one-third of GDP. The state component of foreign debt has declined but commercial short-term debt to foreigners has risen strongly. These positive trends began to reverse in the second half of 2008. Investor concerns over the Russia-Georgia conflict corporate governance issues and the global credit crunch in September caused the Russian stock market to fall by roughly 70% primarily due to margin calls that were difficult for many Russian companies to meet. The global crisis also affected Russia's banking system which faced liquidity problems. Moscow responded quickly in early October 2008 initiating a rescue plan of over $200 billion that was designed to increase liquidity in the financial sector to help firms refinance foreign debt and to support the stock market. The government also unveiled a $20 billion tax cut plan and other safety nets for society and industry. Meanwhile a 70% drop in the price of oil since mid-July further exacerbated imbalances in external accounts and the federal budget. In mid-November mini-devaluations of the currency by the Central Bank caused increased capital flight and froze domestic credit markets resulting in growing unemployment wage arrears and a severe drop in production. Foreign exchange reserves dropped to around $435 billion by end 2008 as the Central Bank defended an overvalued ruble. In the first year of his term President MEDVEDEV outlined a number of economic priorities for Russia including improving infrastructure innovation investment and institutions; reducing the state's role in the economy; reforming the tax system and banking sector; developing one of the biggest financial centers in the world combating corruption and improving the judiciary. The Russian government needs to diversify the economy further as energy and other raw materials still dominate Russian export earnings and federal budget receipts. Russia's infrastructure requires large investments and must be replaced or modernized if the country is to achieve broad-based economic growth. Corruption lack of trust in institutions and more recently exchange rate uncertainty and the global economic crisis continue to dampen domestic and foreign investor sentiment. Russia has made some progress in building the rule of law the bedrock of a modern market economy but much work remains on judicial reform. Moscow continues to seek accession to the WTO and has made some progress but its timeline for entry into the organization continues to slip and the negotiating atmosphere has soured in the wake of the Georgia and global economic crises.,170000000,2007,24 August 1991 (from the Soviet Union),173000000000,2007 est.,68200000000,2007 est.,481000000000,2007 est.,,,$ 102 300 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,6000000000.0,2007 est.,-0.5,NA,$ 339 100 000 000,31 December 2007,,,21098306.0,2009 est.,Russia Day 12 June (1990),1074,2008,-28.0,NA,permafrost over much of Siberia is a major impediment to development;

In succeeding centuries Bulgaria struggled with the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans but by the end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having fought on the losing side in both World Wars Bulgaria fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in 1946. Communist domination ended in 1990 when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy while combating inflation unemployment corruption and crime.

The French assumed control in 1715 developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810 during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base and later an air station playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968.

For most of the period annual growth has been in the order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more equitable income distribution increased life expectancy lowered infant mortality and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy rests on sugar tourism textiles and apparel and financial services and is expanding into fish processing information and communications technology and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than 32 000 offshore entities many aimed at commerce in India South Africa and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion.

In 1940 Romania allied with the Axis powers and participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years later overrun by the Soviets Romania signed an armistice.

The country emerged in 2000 from a punishing three-year recession thanks to strong demand in EU export markets. Domestic consumption and investment have fueled strong GDP growth in recent years but have led to large current account imbalances. Romania's macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a middle class and address Romania's widespread poverty. Corruption and red tape continue to handicap its business environment. Inflation rose in 2007-08 driven in part by strong consumer demand and high wage growth rising energy costs a nation-wide drought affecting food prices and a relaxation of fiscal discipline.

Oil production and its supporting activities contribute about 85% of GDP. Increased oil production supported growth averaging more than 15% per year from 2004 to 2007. A postwar reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Much of the country's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from the 27-year-long civil war. Remnants of the conflict such as widespread land mines still mar the countryside even though an apparently durable peace was established after the death of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for most of the people but half of the country's food must still be imported. In 2005 the government started using a $2 billion line of credit since increased to $7 billion from China to rebuild Angola's public infrastructure and several large-scale projects were completed in 2006. Angola also has large credit lines from Brazil Portugal Germany Spain and the EU. The central bank in 2003 implemented an exchange rate stabilization program using foreign exchange reserves to buy kwanzas out of circulation. This policy became more sustainable in 2005 because of strong oil export earnings; it has significantly reduced inflation. Although consumer inflation declined from 325% in 2000 to under 13% in 2008 the stabilization policy has put pressure on international net liquidity. Angola became a member of OPEC in late 2006 and in late 2007 was assigned a production quota of 1.9 million barrels a day somewhat less than the 2-2.5 million bbl Angola's government had wanted. To fully take advantage of its rich national resources - gold diamonds extensive forests Atlantic fisheries and large oil deposits - Angola will need to implement government reforms increase transparency and reduce corruption. The government has rejected a formal IMF monitored program although it continues Article IV consultations and ad hoc cooperation. Corruption especially in the extractive sectors and the negative effects of large inflows of foreign exchange are major challenges facing Angola.,3307000,2007,11 November 1975 (from Portugal),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,680000000,2006 est.,15.0,NA,$ 17 840 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,4.4,NA,$ 1 166 000 000,31 December 2007,,,1411468.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 11 November (1975),6,2008,0.0,NA,locally heavy rainfall causes periodic flooding on the plateau,slightly less than twice the size of Texas,67.4,2001 est.,38.2,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly or Assembleia Nacional (220 seats; members elected by proportional vote to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 5-6 September 2008 (next to be held in September 2012) election results: percent of vote by party - MPLA 81.6% UNITA 10.4% PRS 3.2% ND 1.2% FNLA 1.1% other 2.5%; seats by party - MPLA 191 UNITA 16 PRS 8 FNLA 3 ND 2,based on Portuguese civil law system and customary law; modified to accommodate political pluralism and increased use of free markets; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP AfDB AU CPLP FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA NAM OAS (observer) OPEC SADC UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO Union Latina UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,2755864.0,2008 est.,5.7,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,overuse of pastures and subsequent soil erosion attributable to population pressures; desertification; deforestation of tropical rain forest in response to both international demand for tropical timber and to domestic use as fuel resulting in loss of biodiversity; soil erosion contributing to water pollution and siltation of rivers and dams; inadequate supplies of potable water,2.0,2008,1.0,2008,3513000000,2006 est.,2764,2008,Cabinda Lobito Luanda Namibe,18.0,NA,14.3,2008 est.,narrow coastal plain rises abruptly to vast interior plateau,general assessment: system inadequate; fewer than one fixed-line per 100 persons; combined fixed line and mobile telephone density exceeded 25 telephones per 100 persons in 2007 domestic: state-owned telecom had monopoly for fixed-lines until 2005; demand outstripped capacity prices were high and services poor; Telecom Namibia through an Angolan company became the first private licensed operator in Angola's fixed-line telephone network; Angola Telecom established mobile-cellular service in Luanda in 1993 and the network has been extended to larger towns; a privately-owned mobile-cellular service provider began operations in 2001 international: country code - 244; landing point for the SAT-3/WASC fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to Europe and Asia; satellite earth stations - 29 (2007),6.12,2009 est.,,,republic; multiparty presidential regime,two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and black with a centered yellow emblem consisting of a five-pointed star within half a cogwheel crossed by a machete (in the style of a hammer and sickle); red represents liberty black the African continent the symbols characterize workers and peasants,used as a transshipment point for cocaine destined for Western Europe and other African states particularly South Africa,$ 17 080 000 000,2008 est.,51429,2001,2.1,2009 est.,13.2,2008 est.,,,$ 110 300 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Dan MOZENA embassy: number 32 Rua Houari Boumedienne (in the Miramar area of Luanda) Luanda mailing address: international mail: Caixa Postal 6468 Luanda; pouch: US Embassy Luanda US Department of State 2550 Luanda Place Washington DC 20521-2550 telephone: [244] (222) 64-1000 FAX: [244] (222) 64-1232,$ 8 800,2008 est.,680000000,2006 est.

After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1806 many of the Dutch settlers (the Boers) trekked north to found their own republics. The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886) spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the native inhabitants. The Boers resisted British encroachments but were defeated in the Boer War (1899-1902); however the British and the Afrikaners as the Boers became known ruled together under the Union of South Africa. In 1948 the National Party was voted into power and instituted a policy of apartheid - the separate development of the races. The first multi-racial elections in 1994 brought an end to apartheid and ushered in black majority rule under the African National Congress (ANC).

However unemployment remains high and outdated infrastructure has constrained growth. At the end of 2007 South Africa began to experience an electricity crisis because state power supplier Eskom suffered supply problems with aged plants necessitating ""load-shedding"" cuts to residents and businesses in the major cities. Daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era - especially poverty lack of economic empowerment among the disadvantaged groups and a shortage of public transportation.

Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963 when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964 sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974 a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983 the Turkish-held area declared itself the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"" (""TRNC"") but it is recognized only by Turkey. The election of a new Cypriot president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both the Turkish and Cypriot Governments to reopen unification negotiations.

Tourism financial services and real estate are the most important sectors. Erratic growth rates over the past decade reflect the economy's reliance on tourism which often fluctuates with political instability in the region and economic conditions in Western Europe. Nevertheless the economy in the area under government control has grown at a rate well above the EU average since 2000. Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2) in May 2005 and adopted the euro as its national currency on 1 January 2008. An aggressive austerity program in the preceding years aimed at paving the way for the euro helped turn a soaring fiscal deficit (6.3% in 2003) into a surplus of 1.2% in 2008 and reduced inflation to 5.1%. This prosperity will come under pressure in 2009 as construction and tourism slow in the face of reduced foreign demand triggered by the ongoing global financial crisis. Growth is expected to slow to less than 2% which would be its lowest level since 2003. As in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots water shortages are a perennial problem; a few desalination plants have been added to existing plants over the last year and are now on line.

Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleanic wars it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I it was closely tied to Austria but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral) the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In 2000 shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering.

The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30% of state revenues. The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EU) since May 1995.

In 1948 the British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula formed the Federation of Malaya which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of Borneo joined the Federation. The first several years of the country's history were marred by a Communist insurgency Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia Philippine claims to Sabah and Singapore's secession from the Federation in 1965.

After coming to office in 2003 former Prime Minister ABDULLAH tried to move the economy farther up the value-added production chain by attracting investments in high technology industries medical technology and pharmaceuticals. The Government of Malaysia is continuing efforts to boost domestic demand to wean the economy off of its dependence on exports. Nevertheless exports - particularly of electronics - remain a significant driver of the economy. As an oil and gas exporter Malaysia has profited from higher world energy prices although the rising cost of domestic gasoline and diesel fuel forced Kuala Lumpur to reduce government subsidies. Malaysia ""unpegged"" the ringgit from the US dollar in 2005 and the currency appreciated 6% per year against the dollar in 2006-08. Although this has helped to hold down the price of imports inflationary pressures began to build in 2007 - in 2008 inflation stood at nearly 6% year-over-year. The government presented its five-year national development agenda in April 2006 through the Ninth Malaysia Plan a comprehensive blueprint for the allocation of the national budget from 2006-10. ABDULLAH unveiled a series of ambitious development schemes for several regions that have had trouble attracting business investment. Real GDP growth averaged about 6% per year under ABDULLAH but regions outside of Kuala Lumpur and the manufacturing hub Penang did not fare as well. The central bank maintains healthy foreign exchange reserves and the regulatory regime has limited Malaysia's exposure to riskier financial instruments and the global financial crisis.

The union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982 but the envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out and the union was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance (MFDC) has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s and several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict. Nevertheless Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa. Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until current President Abdoulaye WADE was elected in 2000.

This reform began with a 50% devaluation of Senegal's currency the CFA franc which was linked at a fixed rate to the French franc. Government price controls and subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy contract by 2.1% in 1993 Senegal made an important turnaround thanks to the reform program with real growth in GDP averaging over 5% annually during 1995-2008. Annual inflation had been pushed down to the single digits. As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy. High unemployment however continues to prompt illegal migrants to flee Senegal in search of better job opportunities in Europe. Senegal was also beset by an energy crisis that caused widespread blackouts in 2006 and 2007. The phosphate industry has struggled for two years to secure capital and reduced output has directly impacted GDP. In 2007 Senegal signed agreements for major new mining concessions for iron zircon and gold with foreign companies.

Large-scale emigration economic dependence on South Africa a severe drought and a prolonged civil war hindered the country's development until the mid 1990's. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989 and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between FRELIMO and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December 2004 Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His elected successor Armando Emilio GUEBUZA promised to continue the sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment.

Socialist mismanagement and a brutal civil war from 1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1987 the government embarked on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to stabilize the economy. These steps combined with donor assistance and with political stability since the multi-party elections in 1994 have led to dramatic improvements in the country's growth rate. Inflation was reduced to single digits during the late 1990s and although it returned to double digits in 2000-06 in 2007 inflation had slowed to 8% while GDP growth reached 7.5%. Fiscal reforms including the introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the customs service have improved the government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains Mozambique remains dependent upon foreign assistance for much of its annual budget and the majority of the population remains below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the country's work force. A substantial trade imbalance persists although the opening of the Mozal aluminum smelter the country's largest foreign investment project to date has increased export earnings. At the end of 2007 and after years of negotiations the government took over Portugal's majority share of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity (HCB) company a dam that was not transferred to Mozambique at independence because of the ensuing civil war and unpaid debts. More power is needed for additional investment projects in titanium extraction and processing and garment manufacturing that could further close the import/export gap. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives and is now at a manageable level. In July 2007 the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a Compact with Mozambique; the Compact entered into force in September 2008 and will continue for five years. Compact projects will focus on improving sanitation roads agriculture and the business regulation environment in an effort to spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country.,3300000,2007,25 June 1975 (from Portugal),0,2005 est.,0,2007 est.,1450000000,2006 est.,17.5,1997 census,$ -975 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,9839000000.0,2006 est.,4.1,NA,$ 877 200 000,31 December 2007,,,2209764.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 25 June (1975),2,2008,0.0,NA,severe droughts; devastating cyclones and floods in central and southern provinces,slightly less than twice the size of California,47.8,2003 est.,41.18,2009 est.,unicameral Assembly of the Republic or Assembleia da Republica (250 seats; members are directly elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: last held 1-2 December 2004 (next to be held on 28 October 2009) election results: percent of vote by party - FRELIMO 62% RENAMO 29.7% other 8.3%; seats by party - FRELIMO 160 RENAMO 90,based on Portuguese civil law system and customary law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP AfDB AU C CPLP FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM (observer) IPU ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MONUC NAM OIC OIF (observer) OPCW SADC UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO Union Latina UNMIS UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,4545975.0,2008 est.,0.8,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,a long civil war and recurrent drought in the hinterlands have resulted in increased migration of the population to urban and coastal areas with adverse environmental consequences; desertification; pollution of surface and coastal waters; elephant poaching for ivory is a problem,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,14620000000,2006 est.,4787,2008,Beira Maputo Nacala,18.0,NA,9.0,2008 est.,mostly coastal lowlands uplands in center high plateaus in northwest mountains in west,general assessment: fair system with an extremely low density of less than 1 fixed line per 100 persons domestic: the telecommunications sector is shackled with a heavy state presence lack of competition and high operating costs and charges; stagnation in the fixed-line network contrasts with rapid growth in the mobile-cellular network; mobile-cellular coverage now includes all the main cities and key roads including those from Maputo to the South African and Swaziland borders the national highway through Gaza and Inhambane provinces the Beira corridor and from Nampula to Nacala international: country code - 258; satellite earth stations - 5 Intelsat (2 Atlantic Ocean and 3 Indian Ocean),5.18,2009 est.,21.0,1997 est.,republic,three equal horizontal bands of green (top) black and yellow with a red isosceles triangle based on the hoist side; the black band is edged in white; centered in the triangle is a yellow five-pointed star bearing a crossed rifle and hoe in black superimposed on an open white book,southern African transit point for South Asian hashish and heroin and South American cocaine probably destined for the European and South African markets; producer of cannabis (for local consumption) and methaqualone (for export to South Africa); corruption and poor regulatory capability makes the banking system vulnerable to money laundering but the lack of a well-developed financial infrastructure limits the country's utility as a money-laundering center,$ 3 458 000 000,2008 est.,30400,2000,1.79,2009 est.,6.5,2008 est.,,,$ 18 950 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador (vacant); Charge d'Affaires Todd C.

Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government - with the support of foreign countries and international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform raising producer prices on export crops increasing prices of petroleum products and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and export earnings. During 1990-2001 the economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the rehabilitation of infrastructure improved incentives for production and exports reduced inflation gradually improved domestic security and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs. Growth continues to be solid despite variability in the price of coffee Uganda's principal export and a consistent upturn in Uganda's export markets. In 2000 Uganda qualified for enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief worth $1.3 billion and Paris Club debt relief worth $145 million.

Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms is widespread with cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than $60 billion since 1989. The government's IMF-mandated austerity measures imposed since late 2006 have reduced the budget deficit from over 9% of GDP in 2006 to 3.3% in 2008. Hungary's impending inability to service its short-term debt - brought on by the global credit crunch in late 2008 - led Budapest to seek and receive an IMF-arranged financial assistance package worth over $25 billion.

Ali SAIBOU was forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections which resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999 BARE was killed in a coup by military officers who promptly restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year. TANDJA was reelected in 2004. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base. The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. A predominately Tuareg ethnic group emerged in February 2007 the Nigerien Movement for Justice (MNJ) and attacked several military targets in Niger's northern region throughout 2007 and 2008.

It is a landlocked Sub-Saharan nation whose economy centers on subsistence crops livestock and some of the world's largest uranium deposits. Drought cycles desertification and strong population growth have undercut the economy. Niger shares a common currency the CFA franc and a common central bank the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) with seven other members of the West African Monetary Union. In December 2000 Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and concluded an agreement with the Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care primary education HIV/AIDS prevention rural infrastructure and other programs geared at poverty reduction. In December 2005 Niger received 100% multilateral debt relief from the IMF which translates into the forgiveness of approximately US $86 million in debts to the IMF excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived from foreign donor resources. Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil gold coal and other mineral resources. Uranium prices have increased sharply in the last few years.

From 2003 to 2007 Brazil ran record trade surpluses and recorded its first current account surpluses since 1992. Productivity gains coupled with high commodity prices contributed to the surge in exports. Brazil improved its debt profile in 2006 by shifting its debt burden toward real denominated and domestically held instruments. LULA da Silva restated his commitment to fiscal responsibility by maintaining the country's primary surplus during the 2006 election. Following his second inauguration in October of that year LULA da Silva announced a package of further economic reforms to reduce taxes and increase investment in infrastructure. Brazil's debt achieved investment grade status early in 2008 but the government's attempt to achieve strong growth while reducing the debt burden created inflationary pressures. For most of 2008 the Central Bank embarked on a restrictive monetary policy to stem these pressures. Since the onset of the global financial crisis in September Brazil's currency and its stock market - Bovespa - have significantly lost value -41% for Bovespa for the year ending 30 December 2008.

The planet's population continues to explode: from 1 billion in 1820 to 2 billion in 1930 3 billion in 1960 4 billion in 1974 5 billion in 1988 and 6 billion in 2000.

Among major economies growth was led by China (9.8%) Russia (7.4%) and India (7.3%). Worldwide nations varied widely in their growth results with Macau (15%) Azerbaijan (13.2%) and Angola (11.6%) registering the highest. Growth rates slowed in all the major industrial countries and most developing countries because of uncertainties in the financial markets and lowered consumer confidence. Externally the nation-state as a bedrock economic-political institution is steadily losing control over international flows of people goods funds and technology. Internally the central government often finds its control over resources slipping as separatist regional movements - typically based on ethnicity - gain momentum e.g. in many of the successor states of the former Soviet Union in the former Yugoslavia in India in Iraq in Indonesia and in Canada. Externally the central government is losing decisionmaking powers to international bodies notably the EU. In Western Europe governments face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The addition of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution desertification underemployment epidemics and famine. Because of their own internal problems and priorities the industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world which at least from an economic point of view are becoming further marginalized. The introduction of the euro as the common currency of much of Western Europe in January 1999 while paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse poses economic risks because of varying levels of income and cultural and political differences among the participating nations. The terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 accentuated a growing risk to global prosperity illustrated for example by the reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist programs. The opening of war in March 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq added new uncertainties to global economic prospects. The complex political difficulties and the high economic cost of establishing domestic order in Iraq became major global problems that continued through 2008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,large areas subject to severe weather (tropical cyclones); natural disasters (earthquakes landslides tsunamis volcanic eruptions),land area about 16 times the size of the US,,,66.57,2009 est.,,all members of the UN are parties to the statute that established the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or World Court,,,,,,2.0,2005 est.,,large areas subject to overpopulation industrial disasters pollution (air water acid rain toxic substances) loss of vegetation (overgrazing deforestation desertification) loss of wildlife soil degradation soil depletion erosion; global warming becoming a greater concern,,,,,,,,,top ten container ports as measured by Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs): Singapore - 27 935 500; Shanghai - 26 150 000; Hong Kong - 23 999 000; Shenzhen (China) - 21 099 100; Pusan (South Korea) - 13 254 703; - Rotterdam - 10 790 604; Dubai (UAE) - 10 650 000; Kaohsiung (Taiwan) - 10 256 829; Hamburg - 9 917 180; Qingdao (China) - 9 462 000 (2007),,,,,the greatest ocean depth is the Mariana Trench at 10 924 m in the Pacific Ocean,general assessment: NA domestic: NA international: NA,2.58,2009 est.,30.0,2007 est.,,,cocaine: worldwide coca leaf cultivation in 2007 amounted to 232 500 hectares; Colombia produced slightly more than two-thirds of the worldwide crop followed by Peru and Bolivia; potential pure cocaine production decreased 7% to 865 metric tons in 2007; Colombia conducts an aggressive coca eradication campaign but both Peruvian and Bolivian Governments are hesitant to eradicate coca in key growing areas; 551 metric tons of export-quality cocaine (85% pure) is documented to have been seized or destroyed in 2005; US consumption of export quality cocaine is estimated to have been in excess of 380 metric tons opiates: worldwide illicit opium poppy cultivation continued to increase in 2007 with a potential opium production of 8 400 metric tons reaching the highest levels recorded since estimates began in mid-1980s; Afghanistan is world's primary opium producer accounting for 95% of the global supply; Southeast Asia - responsible for 9% of global opium - saw marginal increases in production; Latin America produced 1% of global opium but most was refined into heroin destined for the US market; if all potential opium was processed into pure heroin the potential global production would be 1 000 metric tons of heroin in 2007,,,,,1.17,2009 est.,3.8,2008 est.,,,,,,$ 10 400,2008 est.,,

The sector accounts for 95% of exports and nearly half of GDP. Since 2003 the Faroese economy has picked up as a result of higher prices for fish and for housing. Unemployment is minimal and government finances are relatively sound. Oil finds close to the Islands give hope for economically recoverable deposits which could eventually lay the basis for a more diversified economy and lessen dependence on Danish economic assistance. Aided by a substantial annual subsidy (about 15% of GDP) from Denmark the Faroese have a standard of living not far below the Danes and other Scandinavians.,50000,2006,none (part of the Kingdom of Denmark; self-governing overseas administrative division of Denmark),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,16.2,2006 administrative data,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,2.0,NA,,,,,8311.0,2009 est.,Olaifest (Olavasoka) 29 July,12,2008,0.0,NA,NA,eight times the size of Washington DC,,,79.44,2009 est.,unicameral Faroese Parliament or Logting (33 seats; members are elected by popular vote on a proportional basis from the seven constituencies to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 19 January 2008 (next to be held no later than January 2012) election results: percent of vote by party - Union Party 21% Social Democratic Party 19.4% Republican Party 23.3% People's Party 20.1% Center Party 8.4% Self-Government Party 7.2% other 0.6%; seats by party - Republican Party 8 Union Party 7 Social Democratic Party 6 People's Party 7 Center Party 3 Independence Party 2 note: election of two seats to the Danish Parliament was last held on 13 November 2007 (next to be held no later than November 2011); results - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - Republican Party 1 Union Party 1,the laws of Denmark where applicable apply,Arctic Council FAO IMO (associate) NC NIB UPU,3.0,NA,11725.0,2008 est.,,,party to: Marine Dumping - associate member to the London Convention and Ship Pollution,NA,,,1.0,2008,295000000,2006 est.,,,Torshavn Vagur,18.0,NA,8.0,1999 est.,rugged rocky some low peaks; cliffs along most of coast,general assessment: good international communications; good domestic facilities domestic: digitalization was completed in 1998; both NMT (analog) and GSM (digital) mobile telephone systems are installed international: country code - 298; satellite earth stations - 1 Orion; 1 fiber-optic submarine cable to the Shetland Islands linking the Faroe Islands with Denmark and Iceland; fiber-optic submarine cable connection to Canada-Europe cable,2.44,2009 est.,1.4,2007,NA,white with a red cross outlined in blue extending to the edges of the flag; the vertical part of the cross is shifted toward the hoist side in the style of the Dannebrog (Danish flag),,$ 751 000 000,2006,463,2006,0.4,2009 est.,2.4,2005 est.,,,$ 1 000 000 000,2001 est.,none (self-governing overseas administrative division of Denmark),$ 31 000,2001 est.,0,2007 est.

Lansana CONTE came to power in 1984 when the military seized the government after the death of the first president Sekou TOURE. Guinea did not hold democratic elections until 1993 when Gen. CONTE (head of the military government) was elected president of the civilian government. He was reelected in 1998 and again in 2003 though all the polls were marred by irregularities. History repeated itself in December 2008 when following President CONTE's death Capt. Moussa Dadis CAMARA led a military coup seizing power and suspending the constitution as well as political and union activity. Guinea has maintained some semblance of internal stability despite spillover effects from conflict in Sierra Leone and Liberia. As those countries have rebuilt however Guinea's own vulnerability to political and economic crisis has increased.

The country has almost half of the world's bauxite reserves. The mining sector accounts for more than 70% of exports. Long-run improvements in government fiscal arrangements literacy and the legal framework are needed if the country is to move out of poverty. Investor confidence has been sapped by rampant corruption a lack of electricity and other infrastructure a lack of skilled workers and the political uncertainty because of the death of President Lansana CONTE in December 2008. Guinea is trying to reengage with the IMF and World Bank which cut off most assistance in 2003 and is working closely with technical advisors from the U.S. Treasury Department the World Bank and IMF seeking to return to a fully funded program. Growth rose slightly in 2006-08 primarily due to increases in global demand and commodity prices on world markets but the standard of living fell. The Guinea franc depreciated sharply as the prices for basic necessities like food and fuel rose beyond the reach of most Guineans.

When the latter dissolved in 1830 Panama remained part of Colombia. With US backing Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977 an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the subsequent decades. With US help dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal the area supporting the Canal and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by the end of 1999. In October 2006 Panamanians approved an ambitious plan to expand the Canal.

Services include operating the Panama Canal banking the Colon Free Zone insurance container ports flagship registry and tourism. Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is scheduled to be completed by 2014 at a cost of $5.3 billion - about 25% of current GDP. The expansion project will more than double the Canal's capacity enabling it to accommodate ships that are now too large to transverse the transoceanic crossway and should help to reduce the high unemployment rate. Strong economic performance has reduced the national poverty level to 29% in 2008; however Panama has the second most unequal income distribution in Latin America.

The abolition of slavery led to black settlement of urban areas and the importation of indentured servants from India to work the sugar plantations. This ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to turbulent politics. Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966 and since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992 Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is considered the country's first free and fair election since independence. After his death five years later his wife Janet JAGAN became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health.

The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six commodities - sugar gold bauxite shrimp timber and rice - which represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. Economic recovery since the 2005 flood-related contraction has been buoyed by increases in remittances and foreign direct investment in the sugar and rice industries as well as the mining sector. The bauxite mining sector should benefit in the near term from restructuring and partial privatization and the state-owned sugar industry will conduct efficiency increasing modernizations. Export earnings from agriculture and mining have remained flat as rising commodity prices have offset declining production while the import bill has risen driven by higher energy costs. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure. The government is juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. In March 2007 the Inter-American Development Bank Guyana's principal donor canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million debt equivalent to nearly 48% of GDP which along with other Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt forgiveness brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 120% in 2007. Guyana became heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking state-led development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. Guyana's entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) in January 2006 has broadened the country's export market primarily in the raw materials sector.,281400,2005,26 May 1966 (from the UK),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,1.1,2002 census,$ -333 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,0.0,NA,$ 739 300 000,31 December 2007,,,144622.0,2009 est.,Republic Day 23 February (1970),8,2008,0.0,NA,flash floods are a constant threat during rainy seasons,slightly smaller than Idaho,98.8,2003 est.,66.68,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly (65 seats; members elected by popular vote also not more than 4 non-elected non-voting ministers and 2 non-elected non-voting parliamentary secretaries appointed by the president; to serve five-year terms) elections: last held 28 August 2006 (next to be held by August 2011) election results: percent of vote by party - PPP/C 54.6% PNC/R 34% AFC 8.1% other 3.3%; seats by party - PPP/C 36 PNC/R 22 AFC 5 other 2,based on English common law with certain admixtures of Roman-Dutch law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP C Caricom CDB FAO G-77 IADB IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM (observer) ISO (subscriber) ITU ITUC LAES MIGA NAM OAS OIC OPANAL OPCW PCA RG UN UNASUR UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,220797.0,2008 est.,1.8,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,water pollution from sewage and agricultural and industrial chemicals; deforestation,1.0,2008,3.0,2008,600000000,2007,,,Georgetown,18.0,NA,2.4,2008 est.,mostly rolling highlands; low coastal plain; savanna in south,general assessment: fair system for long-distance service domestic: microwave radio relay network for trunk lines; fixed-line teledensity is about 15 per 100 persons; many areas still lack fixed-line telephone services; mobile-cellular teledensity reached 37 per 100 persons in 2005 international: country code - 592; tropospheric scatter to Trinidad; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean),2.03,2009 est.,11.0,2007,republic,green with a red isosceles triangle (based on the hoist side) superimposed on a long yellow arrowhead; there is a narrow black border between the red and yellow and a narrow white border between the yellow and the green,transshipment point for narcotics from South America - primarily Venezuela - to Europe and the US; producer of cannabis; rising money laundering related to drug trafficking and human smuggling,$ 1 299 000 000,2008 est.,7970,2000,0.18,2009 est.,3.2,2008 est.,,,$ 3 010 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador John Melvin JONES embassy: US Embassy 100 Young and Duke Streets Kingston Georgetown mailing address: P.

It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler fertile central highlands. The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In 1821 Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America but this federation disintegrated in 1838 at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century only two brief periods of violence have marred the country's democratic development. Although it still maintains a large agricultural sector Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.

Exports have become more diversified in the past 10 years due to the growth of the high-tech manufacturing sector which is dominated by the microprocessor industry and the production of medical devices. Tourism continues to bring in foreign exchange as Costa Rica's impressive biodiversity makes it a key destination for ecotourism. Foreign investors remain attracted by the country's political stability and relatively high education levels as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the free-trade zones. Costa Rica has attracted one of the highest levels of foreign direct investment per capita in Latin America. Poverty has remained around 20% for nearly 20 years and the strong social safety net that had been put into place by the government has eroded due to increased financial constraints on government expenditures. Immigration from Nicaragua has increasingly become a concern for the government. The estimated 300 000-500 000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica legally and illegally are an important source of - mostly unskilled - labor but also place heavy demands on the social welfare system. Under the ARIAS administration the government has made strides in reducing internal and external debt - in 2007 Costa Rica had its first budget surplus in 50 years. Reducing inflation remains a difficult problem because of rising commodity import prices and labor market rigidities though lower oil prices will decrease upward pressures. The Central Bank is moving towards a more flexible exchange rate system to focus on inflation targeting by 2010.

Overrun by Germany in both World Wars it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year.

The industrial sector initially dominated by steel has become increasingly diversified to include chemicals rubber and other products. Growth in the financial sector which now accounts for about 28% of GDP has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Most banks are foreign owned and have extensive foreign dealings. Agriculture is based on small family-owned farms. The economy depends on foreign and cross-border workers for about 60% of its labor force. Although Luxembourg like all EU members suffered from the global economic slump in the early part of this decade the country continues to enjoy an extraordinarily high standard of living - GDP per capita ranks third in the world after Liechtenstein and Qatar.

In a referendum held in 1967 Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication links. A series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997 and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. In response to these talks the Gibraltar Government called a referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since the referendum tripartite talks on other issues have been held with Spain the UK and Gibraltar and in September 2006 a three-way agreement was signed. Spain agreed to remove restrictions on air movements to speed up customs procedures to implement international telephone dialing and to allow mobile roaming agreements. Britain agreed to pay increased pensions to Spaniards who had been employed in Gibraltar before the border closed. Spain will be allowed to open a cultural institute from which the Spanish flag will fly.

GDP growth averaged 6% in 1995-2007 but economic activity dropped sharply in 2008 and Ireland entered into a recession for the first time in more than a decade with the onset of the world financial crisis and subsequent severe slowdown in the property and construction markets. Agriculture once the most important sector is now dwarfed by industry and services. Although the export sector dominated by foreign multinationals remains a key component of Ireland's economy construction most recently fueled economic growth along with strong consumer spending and business investment. Property prices rose more rapidly in Ireland in the decade up to 2006 than in any other developed world economy. Per capita GDP also surged during Ireland's high-growth years and in 2007 surpassed that of the United States.

A series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater autonomy; independence came in 1960. Following nearly 16 years of military rule a new constitution was adopted in 1999 and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. The government continues to face the daunting task of reforming a petroleum-based economy whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement and institutionalizing democracy. In addition Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and religious tensions. Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian rule since independence.

Nigeria's former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector which provides 95% of foreign exchange earnings and about 80% of budgetary revenues. Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in August 2000 Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the Paris Club and a $1 billion credit from the IMF both contingent on economic reforms. Nigeria pulled out of its IMF program in April 2002 after failing to meet spending and exchange rate targets making it ineligible for additional debt forgiveness from the Paris Club. Since 2008 the government has begun showing the political will to implement the market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF such as to modernize the banking system to curb inflation by blocking excessive wage demands and to resolve regional disputes over the distribution of earnings from the oil industry. In 2003 the government began deregulating fuel prices announced the privatization of the country's four oil refineries and instituted the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy a domestically designed and run program modeled on the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for fiscal and monetary management. In November 2005 Abuja won Paris Club approval for a debt-relief deal that eliminated $18 billion of debt in exchange for $12 billion in payments - a total package worth $30 billion of Nigeria's total $37 billion external debt. The deal requires Nigeria to be subject to stringent IMF reviews. Based largely on increased oil exports and high global crude prices GDP rose strongly in 2007 and 2008. President YAR'ADUA has pledged to continue the economic reforms of his predecessor with emphasis on infrastructure improvements. Infrastructure is the main impediment to growth. The government is working toward developing stronger public-private partnerships for electricity and roads.,40395000,2007,1 October 1960 (from the UK),21200000000,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,12900000000,2007 est.,10.0,NA,$ 4 847 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,3.8,NA,$ 35 680 000 000,31 December 2007,,,18850650.0,2009 est.,Independence Day (National Day) 1 October (1960),68,2008,0.0,NA,periodic droughts; flooding,slightly more than twice the size of California,68.0,2003 est.,46.94,2009 est.,bicameral National Assembly consists of the Senate (109 seats 3 from each state plus 1 from Abuja; members elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) and House of Representatives (360 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: Senate - last held 21 April 2007 (next to be held in April 2011); House of Representatives - last held 21 April 2007 (next to be held in April 2011) election results: Senate - percent of vote by party - PDP 53.7% ANPP 27.9% AD 9.7% other 8.7%; seats by party - PDP 76 ANPP 27 AD 6; House of Representatives - percent of vote by party - PDP 54.5% ANPP 27.4% AD 8.8% UNPP 2.8% NPD 1.9% APGA 1.6% PRP 0.8%; seats by party - PDP 76 ANPP 27 AD 6 UNPP 2 APGA 2 NPD 1 PRP 1 vacant 1,based on English common law Islamic law (in 12 northern states) and traditional law; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,ACP AfDB AU C ECOWAS FAO G-15 G-24 G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MINURCAT MINURSO MONUC NAM OAS (observer) OIC OPCW OPEC PCA UN UNAMID UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNMIL UNMIS UNOCI UNOMIG UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,30638979.0,2008 est.,1.5,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,soil degradation; rapid deforestation; urban air and water pollution; desertification; oil pollution - water air and soil; has suffered serious damage from oil spills; loss of arable land; rapid urbanization,2.0,2008,2.0,2008,22110000000,2006 est.,3505,2008,Bonny Inshore Terminal Calabar Lagos,18.0,NA,2.8,2008 est.,southern lowlands merge into central hills and plateaus; mountains in southeast plains in north,general assessment: further expansion and modernization of the fixed-line telephone network is needed domestic: the addition of a second fixed-line provider in 2002 resulted in faster growth but subscribership remains only about 1 per 100 persons; wireless telephony has grown rapidly in part responding to the shortcomings of the fixed-line network; multiple service providers operate nationally; mobile-cellular teledensity reached 30 per 100 persons in 2007 international: country code - 234; landing point for the SAT-3/WASC fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to Europe and Asia; satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (2 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean) (2007),4.91,2009 est.,4.9,2007 est.,federal republic,three equal vertical bands of green (hoist side) white and green,a transit point for heroin and cocaine intended for European East Asian and North American markets; consumer of amphetamines; safe haven for Nigerian narcotraffickers operating worldwide; major money-laundering center; massive corruption and criminal activity; Nigeria has improved some anti-money-laundering controls resulting in its removal from the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF's) Noncooperative Countries and Territories List in June 2006; Nigeria's anti-money-laundering regime continues to be monitored by FATF,$ 45 490 000 000,2008 est.,193200,2004,2.0,2009 est.,6.1,2008 est.,2.0,2007,$ 338 100 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Robin SANDERS embassy: 1075 Diplomatic Drive Central District Area Abuja mailing address: P.

The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada (Colombia) Venezuela and Quito - gained their independence between 1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When Quito withdrew in 1830 the traditional name was changed in favor of the ""Republic of the Equator."" Between 1904 and 1942 Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although Ecuador marked 25 years of civilian governance in 2004 the period has been marred by political instability. Protests in Quito have contributed to the mid-term ouster of Ecuador's last three democratically elected Presidents.

In 1999/2000 Ecuador suffered a severe economic crisis with GDP contracting by more than 6%. Poverty increased significantly the banking system collapsed and Ecuador defaulted on its external debt later that year. In March 2000 Congress approved a series of structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of the US dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the economy and positive growth returned in the years that followed helped by high oil prices remittances and increased non-traditional exports. From 2002-06 the economy grew 5.5% the highest five-year average in 25 years. The poverty rate declined but remained high at 38% in 2006. In 2006 the government imposed a windfall revenue tax on foreign oil companies leading to the suspension of free trade negotiations with the US. These measures led to a drop in petroleum production in 2007. President Rafael CORREA raised the specter of debt default and followed through on those threats in December 2008 by defaulting on some commercial bond obligations. He also decreed a higher windfall revenue tax on private oil companies then renegotiated their contracts to overcome the debilitating effect of the tax. This generated economic uncertainty; private investment has dropped and economic growth has slowed.,10086000,2007,24 May 1822 (from Spain),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,280000000,2006 est.,5.0,NA,$ 1 194 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,861000000.0,2006 est.,2.1,NA,$ 8 926 000 000,31 December 2007,,,2708470.0,2009 est.,Independence Day (independence of Quito) 10 August (1809),37,2008,0.0,NA,frequent earthquakes; landslides; volcanic activity; floods; periodic droughts,slightly smaller than Nevada,91.0,2001 census,75.3,2009 est.,unicameral National Congress or Congreso Nacional (100 seats; members are elected through a party-list proportional representation system to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 15 October 2006 (next to be held 26 April 2009) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PRIAN 28; PSP 24; PSC 13; ID 7; PRE 6; MUPP-NP 6; RED 5; UDC 5; other 6; note - defections by members of National Congress are commonplace resulting in frequent changes in the numbers of seats held by the various parties note: when a Constituent Assembly was convened to draft a new constitution the National Congress was placed on indefinite recess and replaced by a legislative committee; the legislative committee will continue to function until a new National Assembly is elected in April 2009,based on civil law system; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,CAN FAO G-77 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAES LAIA Mercosur (associate) MIGA MINURCAT MINUSTAH NAM OAS OPANAL OPCW OPEC PCA RG UN UNASUR UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO Union Latina UNMIL UNMIS UNOCI UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,200.0,NA,3536602.0,2008 est.,2.8,2006,party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol Antarctic Treaty Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,deforestation; soil erosion; desertification; water pollution; pollution from oil production wastes in ecologically sensitive areas of the Amazon Basin and Galapagos Islands,35.0,2008,3.0,2008,14840000000,2006 est.,965,2008,Esmeraldas Guayaquil Manta Puerto Bolivar,18.0,NA,5.5,2008 est.,coastal plain (costa) inter-Andean central highlands (sierra) and flat to rolling eastern jungle (oriente),general assessment: generally elementary but being expanded domestic: fixed-line services provided by three state-owned enterprises; plans to transfer the state-owned operators to private ownership have repeatedly failed; fixed-line density stands at about 13 per 100 persons; mobile cellular use has surged and has a subscribership of nearly 75 per 100 persons international: country code - 593; landing point for the PAN-AM submarine telecommunications cable that provides links to the west coast of South America Panama Colombia Venezuela and extending onward to Aruba and the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2007),2.51,2009 est.,8.7,2008 est.,republic,three horizontal bands of yellow (top double width) blue and red with the coat of arms superimposed at the center of the flag; similar to the flag of Colombia which is shorter and does not bear a coat of arms,significant transit country for cocaine originating in Colombia and Peru with much of the US-bound cocaine passing through Ecuadorian Pacific waters; importer of precursor chemicals used in production of illicit narcotics; attractive location for cash-placement by drug traffickers laundering money because of dollarization and weak anti-money-laundering regime; increased activity on the northern frontier by trafficking groups and Colombian insurgents (2008),$ 17 790 000 000,2008 est.,43670,2006,1.5,2009 est.,5.9,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 107 100 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Heather HODGES embassy: Avenida Avigiras E12-170 y Avenida Eloy Alfaro Quito mailing address: Avenida Guayacanes N52-205 y Avenida Avigiras telephone: [593] (2) 398-5000 FAX: [593] (2) 398-5100 consulate(s) general: Guayaquil,$ 7 500,2008 est.,280000000,2006 est.

After World War II a truncated Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968 an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize Communist party rule and create ""socialism with a human face.""

Maintaining an open investment climate has been a key element of the Czech Republic's transition from a communist centrally planned economy to a functioning market economy. As a member of the European Union with an advantageous location in the center of Europe a relatively low cost structure and a well-qualified labor force the Czech Republic is an attractive destination for foreign investment. Prior to its EU accession in 2004 the Czech government harmonized its laws and regulations with those of the European Union. The government plans to meet the criteria for joining the euro area around 2012. The small open export-driven Czech economy grew by over 6% annually from 2005-2007 and the strong growth continued throughout the first three quarters of 2008. Despite the global financial crisis the conservative Czech financial system has remained relatively healthy. The rate of Czech economic growth however began to fall in the fourth quarter of 2008 mainly due to a significant drop in demand for Czech exports in Western Europe.

Crude oil and natural gas production account for just over half of GDP and more than 90% of exports. Per capita GDP is among the highest in Asia and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The government provides for all medical services and free education through the university level and subsidizes rice and housing. Brunei's leaders are concerned that steadily increased integration into the world economy will undermine internal social cohesion. Plans for the future include upgrading the labor force reducing unemployment strengthening the banking and tourist sectors increasing agricultural production and in general further widening the economic base beyond oil and gas.,339800,2007,1 January 1984 (from the UK),9400000000,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,3990000000,2006 est.,10.0,NA,$ 7 101 000 000,2007 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,2.6,NA,$ 2 380 000 000,31 December 2007,,,92543.0,2009 est.,National Day 23 February (1984); note - 1 January 1984 was the date of independence from the UK 23 February 1984 was the date of independence from British protection,8,2008,0.0,NA,typhoons earthquakes and severe flooding are rare,slightly smaller than Delaware,92.7,2001 census,75.74,2009 est.,The Sultan appointed a council with 29 members as of 2 September 2005; the council has met in March of each year since then elections: last held in March 1962 (date of next election NA) note: The Legislative Council met on 25 September 2004 for first time in 20 years with 21 members appointed by the Sultan; it passed constitutional amendments calling for a 45-seat council with 15 elected members,based on English common law; for Muslims Islamic Sharia law supersedes civil law in a number of areas; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB APEC APT ARF ASEAN C EAS G-77 IBRD ICAO ICRM IDB IFRCS ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU NAM OIC OPCW UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,108356.0,2008 est.,4.5,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,seasonal smoke/haze resulting from forest fires in Indonesia,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,3145000000,2007 est.,,,Lumut Muara Seria,,,1.8,2006 est.,flat coastal plain rises to mountains in east; hilly lowland in west,general assessment: service throughout the country is excellent; international service is good to Southeast Asia Middle East Western Europe and the US domestic: every service available international: country code - 673; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 optical telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to Asia the Middle East and Europe; the Asia-America Gateway submarine cable network scheduled for completion by late 2008 will provide new links to Asia and the US; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean and 1 Pacific Ocean) (2007),1.91,2009 est.,3.7,2008,constitutional sultanate,yellow with two diagonal bands of white (top almost double width) and black starting from the upper hoist side; the national emblem in red is superimposed at the center; the emblem includes a swallow-tailed flag on top of a winged column within an upturned crescent above a scroll and flanked by two upraised hands,drug trafficking and illegally importing controlled substances are serious offenses in Brunei and carry a mandatory death penalty,$ 2 055 000 000,2007 est.,3650,2005,1.76,2009 est.,0.4,2008 est.,3.0,2007,$ 20 250 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador William E.

No formal territorial claims were made until 1770 when Capt. James COOK took possession in the name of Great Britain. Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. In recent decades Australia has transformed itself into an internationally competitive advanced market economy. It boasted one of the OECD's fastest growing economies during the 1990s a performance due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s.

Emphasis on reforms low inflation a housing market boom and growing ties with China have been key factors over the course of the economy's 17 solid years of expansion. Robust business and consumer confidence and high export prices for raw materials and agricultural products fueled the economy in recent years particularly in mining states. Drought robust import demand and a strong currency pushed the trade deficit up however while infrastructure bottlenecks and a tight labor market constrained growth in export volumes and stoked inflation through mid-2008. The unwinding of the yen-based carry trade in late 2008 has contributed to a weakening of the Australian dollar. Tight global liquidity has challenged Australia's banking sector which relies heavily on international wholesale markets for funding. The economy remains relatively healthy despite falling export commodity prices.

Conservative clerical forces established a theocratic system of government with ultimate political authority vested in a learned religious scholar referred to commonly as the Supreme Leader who according to the constitution is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts. US-Iranian relations have been strained since a group of Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January 1981. During 1980-88 Iran fought a bloody indecisive war with Iraq that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes between US Navy and Iranian military forces between 1987 and 1988. Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its activities in Lebanon and elsewhere in the world and remains subject to US UN and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of its continued involvement in terrorism and its nuclear weapons ambitions. Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and similarly a reformer Majles (parliament) in 2000 a campaign to foster political reform in response to popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement floundered as conservative politicians through the control of unelected institutions prevented reform measures from being enacted and increased repressive measures. Starting with nationwide municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections in 2004 conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected government institutions which culminated with the August 2005 inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. The UN Security Council has passed a number of resolutions (1696 in July 2006 1737 in December 2006 1747 in March 2007 1803 in March 2008 and 1835 in September 2008) calling for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities and comply with its IAEA obligations and responsibilities. Resolutions 1737 1477 and 1803 subject a number of Iranian individuals and entities involved in Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs to sanctions.

Price controls subsidies and other rigidities weigh down the economy undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth. Significant informal market activity flourishes. Corruption and shortages of goods are widespread. President Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD has proposed reforms to Iran's system of price controls and subsidies particularly on food and energy. However previous government-led efforts at reform - such as fuel rationing in July 2007 and the imposition of the Value-Added Tax (VAT) in October 2008 - were met with stiff resistance and violent protests. High oil prices in recent years allowed Iran to greatly increase its export earnings and amass nearly $100 billion in foreign exchange reserves. But with oil prices currently below $40 per barrel the Iranian government is facing difficulties. Tehran has formulated a 2009 budget that anticipates lower oil prices. The government has drawn down the country's Oil Stabilization Fund and may be dipping into foreign exchange reserves. Iran continues to suffer from double-digit unemployment and inflation - inflation climbed to a 28% annual rate in 2008. Underemployment among Iran's educated youth has convinced many to seek jobs overseas resulting in a significant ""brain drain.""",29770000,2007,1 April 1979 (Islamic Republic of Iran proclaimed),6200000000,2007 est.,6100000000,2007 est.,111800000000,2007 est.,2.0,NA,$ 16 660 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,2540000000.0,2006 est.,2.1,NA,$ 109 700 000 000,31 December 2007,,,17148290.0,2009 est.,Republic Day 1 April (1979),74,2008,-28.0,NA,periodic droughts floods; dust storms sandstorms; earthquakes,slightly smaller than Alaska,77.0,2002 est.,71.14,2009 est.,unicameral Islamic Consultative Assembly or Majles-e-Shura-ye-Eslami or Majles (290 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 14 March 2008 with a runoff held 25 April 2008 (next to be held in 2012) election results: percent of vote - NA; seats by party - conservatives/Islamists 167 reformers 39 independents 74 religious minorities 5 other 5,based on Sharia law system; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,CP ECO FAO G-15 G-24 G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU MIGA NAM OIC OPCW OPEC PCA SAARC (observer) SCO (observer) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNITAR UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO (observer),12.0,NA,19638751.0,2008 est.,2.5,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: Environmental Modification Law of the Sea Marine Life Conservation,air pollution especially in urban areas from vehicle emissions refinery operations and industrial effluents; deforestation; overgrazing; desertification; oil pollution in the Persian Gulf; wetland losses from drought; soil degradation (salination); inadequate supplies of potable water; water pollution from raw sewage and industrial waste; urbanization,1.0,2008,6.0,2008,193000000000,2006 est.,8442,2008,Assaluyeh Bandar Abbas Bandar-e-Eman Khomeyni,18.0,NA,4.5,2008 est.,rugged mountainous rim; high central basin with deserts mountains; small discontinuous plains along both coasts,general assessment: currently being modernized and expanded with the goal of not only improving the efficiency and increasing the volume of the urban service but also bringing telephone service to several thousand villages not presently connected domestic: the addition of new fiber cables and modern switching and exchange systems installed by Iran's state-owned telecom company have improved and expanded the main line network greatly; main line availability has more than doubled to nearly 24 million lines since 2000; additionally mobile service has increased dramatically serving nearly 30 million subscribers in 2007 international: country code - 98; submarine fiber-optic cable to UAE with access to Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG); Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) fiber-optic line runs from Azerbaijan through the northern portion of Iran to Turkmenistan with expansion to Georgia and Azerbaijan; HF radio and microwave radio relay to Turkey Azerbaijan Pakistan Afghanistan Turkmenistan Syria Kuwait Tajikistan and Uzbekistan; satellite earth stations - 13 (9 Intelsat and 4 Inmarsat) (2007),1.71,2009 est.,12.5,2008 est.,theocratic republic,three equal horizontal bands of green (top) white and red; the national emblem (a stylized representation of the word Allah in the shape of a tulip a symbol of martyrdom) in red is centered in the white band; ALLAH AKBAR (God is Great) in white Arabic script is repeated 11 times along the bottom edge of the green band and 11 times along the top edge of the red band,despite substantial interdiction efforts and considerable control measures along the border with Afghanistan Iran remains one of the primary transshipment routes for Southwest Asian heroin to Europe; suffers one of the highest opiate addiction rates in the world and has an increasing problem with synthetic drugs; lacks anti-money laundering laws; has reached out to neighboring countries to share counter-drug intelligence,$ 67 250 000 000,2008 est.,172927,2006,0.88,2009 est.,6.5,2008 est.,14.0,2007,$ 842 000 000 000,2008 est.,none; note - the US Interests Section is located in the Embassy of Switzerland No. 39 Shahid Mousavi (Golestan 5th) Pasdaran Ave. Tehran Iran; telephone [98] 21 2254 2178/2256 5273; FAX [98] 21 2258 0432,$ 12 800,2008 est.,111900000000,2007 est.

Algeria's primary political party the National Liberation Front (FLN) has dominated politics ever since. Many Algerians in the subsequent generation were not satisfied however and moved to counter the FLN's centrality in Algerian politics. The surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 balloting spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. The government later allowed elections featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based parties but did not appease the activists who progressively widened their attacks. The fighting escalated into an insurgency which saw intense fighting between 1992-98 and which resulted in over 100 000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s and FIS's armed wing the Islamic Salvation Army disbanded in January 2000. However small numbers of armed militants persist in confronting government forces and conducting ambushes and occasional attacks on villages. The army placed Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA in the presidency in 1999 in a fraudulent election but claimed neutrality in his 2004 landslide reelection victory. Longstanding problems continue to face BOUTEFLIKA in his second term including large-scale unemployment a shortage of housing unreliable electrical and water supplies government inefficiencies and corruption and the continuing activities of extremist militants. The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) in 2006 merged with al-Qaida to form al-Qaida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb which since has launched an ongoing series of kidnappings and bombings - including high-profile mass-casualty suicide attacks targeted against the Algerian government and Western interests.

Algeria has the eighth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the fourth-largest gas exporter; it ranks 15th in oil reserves. Sustained high oil prices in recent years have helped improve Algeria's financial and macroeconomic indicators. Algeria is running substantial trade surpluses and building up record foreign exchange reserves. Algeria has decreased its external debt to less than 5% of GDP after repaying its Paris Club and London Club debt in 2006. Real GDP has risen due to higher oil output and increased government spending. The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector however has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards.

Economic growth will decelerate in 2009 due to the global slowdown and to El Salvador's dependence on exports to the US and remittances from the US. El Salvador leads the region in remittances per capita with inflows equivalent to nearly all export income. In 2006 El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). CAFTA has bolstered the export of processed foods sugar and ethanol and supported investment in the maquila sector. The SACA administration has sought to diversify the economy focusing on regional transportation and tourism. El Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment and has embarked on a wave of privatizations extending to telecom electricity distribution banking and pension funds. In late 2006 the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year $461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region through investments in education public services enterprise development and transportation infrastructure.

The country has no known mineral resources and few exports and is almost entirely dependent upon imported food and fuel. Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. Fewer than 1 000 tourists on average visit Tuvalu annually. Job opportunities are scarce and public sector workers make up most of those employed. About 15% of the adult male population work as seamen on merchant ships abroad and remittances are a vital source of income contributing around $4 million in 2006. Substantial income is received annually from the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia NZ and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and conservative withdrawals this fund grew from an initial $17 million to an estimated value of $77 million in 2006. The TFF contributed nearly $9 million towards the government budget in 2006 and is an important cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. The US Government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu because of payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries. In an effort to ensure financial stability and sustainability the government is pursuing public sector reforms including privatization of some government functions and personnel cuts. Tuvalu also derives royalties from the lease of its "".tv"" Internet domain name with revenue of more than $2 million in 2006. A minor source of government revenue comes from the sale of stamps and coins. With merchandise exports only a fraction of merchandise imports continued reliance must be placed on fishing and telecommunications license fees remittances from overseas workers official transfers and income from overseas investments.

The Marshall Islands received more than $1 billion in aid from the US from 1986-2002.

Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts tuna processing and copra. The tourist industry now a small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10% of the labor force remains the best hope for future added income. The islands have few natural resources and imports far exceed exports.

Although Chile declared its independence in 1810 decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83) Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present northern regions. It was not until the 1880s that the Mapuche Indians were completely subjugated. After a series of elected governments a three-year-old Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by Augusto PINOCHET who ruled until a freely elected president was installed in 1990. Sound economic policies maintained consistently since the 1980s have contributed to steady growth reduced poverty rates by over half and have helped secure the country's commitment to democratic and representative government.

Exports account for 40% of GDP with commodities making up some three-quarters of total exports. Copper alone provides one-third of government revenue. During the early 1990s Chile's reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from the military in 1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the military government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% during 1991-97 but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies implemented to keep the current account deficit in check and because of lower export earnings - the latter a product of the global financial crisis. A severe drought exacerbated the situation in 1999 reducing crop yields and causing hydroelectric shortfalls and electricity rationing and Chile experienced negative economic growth for the first time in more than 15 years. In the years since then growth has averaged 4% per year. Chile deepened its longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of a free trade agreement with the US which took effect on 1 January 2004. Chile claims to have more bilateral or regional trade agreements than any other country. It has 57 such agreements (not all of them full free trade agreements) including with the European Union Mercosur China India South Korea and Mexico. Over the past five years foreign direct investment inflows have quadrupled to some $17 billion in 2008. The Chilean government conducts a rule-based countercyclical fiscal policy accumulating surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during periods of high copper prices and economic growth and allowing deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and growth.

Known as Siam until 1939 Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during World War II Thailand became a US treaty ally following the conflict. A military coup in September 2006 ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat. The interim government held elections in December 2007 that saw the former pro-THAKSIN People's Power Party (PPP) emerge at the head of a coalition government. The anti-THAKSIN People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) in May 2008 began street demonstrations against the new government eventually occupying the prime minister's office in August. Clashes in October 2008 between PAD protesters blocking parliament and police resulted in the death of at least two people. The PAD occupied Bangkok's international airports briefly ending their protests in early December 2008 following a court ruling that dissolved the ruling PPP and two other coalition parties for election violations. The Democrat Party then formed a new coalition government with the support of some of THAKSIN's former political allies and ABHISIT Wetchachiwa became prime minister.

However overall economic growth has fallen sharply - averaging 4.9% from 2005 to 2007 - as persistent political crisis stalled infrastructure mega-projects eroded investor and consumer confidence and damaged the country's international image. Exports were the key economic driver as foreign investment and consumer demand stalled. Export growth from January 2005 to November 2008 averaged 17.5% annually. Business uncertainty escalated however following the September 2006 coup when the military-installed government imposed capital controls and considered far-reaching changes to foreign investment rules and other business legislation. Although controversial capital controls have since been lifted and business rules largely remain unchanged investor sentiment has not recovered. Moreover the 2008 global financial crisis further darkened Thailand's economic horizon.

In the early 17th century the French established a presence on Hispaniola. In 1697 Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island which later became Haiti. The French colony based on forestry and sugar-related industries became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean but only through the heavy importation of African slaves and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th century Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle Haiti became the first black republic to declare independence in 1804. The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere Haiti has been plagued by political violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE in February 2004 an interim government took office to organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).

Two-thirds of all Haitians depend on the agricultural sector mainly small-scale subsistence farming and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. While the economy has recovered in recent years registering positive growth since 2005 four tropical storms in 2008 severely damaged the transportation infrastructure and agricultural sector. US economic engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act passed in December 2006 has boosted apparel exports and investment by providing tariff-free access to the US. HOPE II passed in October 2008 has further improved the export environment for the apparel sector by extending preferences to 2018; the apparel sector accounts for two-thirds of Haitian exports and nearly one-tenth of GDP. Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange equaling nearly a quarter of GDP and more than twice the earnings from exports. Haiti suffers from high inflation a lack of investment because of insecurity and limited infrastructure and a severe trade deficit. In 2005 Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank paving the way for reengagement with the Bank. Haiti is expected to receive debt forgiveness for about $525 million of its debt through the Highly-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative by mid-2009.

In stages over the next dozen years Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A ""republic"" was proclaimed in 1958 but in actuality a series of strongmen ruled the country until 2003. The last was SADDAM Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990 Iraq seized Kuwait but was expelled by US-led UN coalition forces during the Gulf War of January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. US forces remained in Iraq under a UNSC mandate until 31 December 2008 and under a bilateral Security Agreement thereafter helping to provide security and to support the freely elected government. In October 2005 Iraqis approved a constitution in a national referendum and pursuant to this document elected a 275-member Council of Representatives (CoR) in December 2005. After the election Ibrahim al-JAAFARI was selected as prime minister; he was replaced by Nuri al-MALIKI in May 2006. The CoR approved most cabinet ministers in May 2006 marking the transition to Iraq's first constitutional government in nearly a half century. On 31 January 2009 Iraq held elections for provincial councils in all provinces except for the three provinces comprising the Kurdistan Regional Government and at-Ta'mim (Kirkuk) province.",,,crude oil 84% crude materials excluding fuels 8% food and live animals 5%,19.74,31 December 2007,5.03,July 2009 est.,918.0,2008,$ 93 800 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,18 governorates (muhafazat singular - muhafazah) and 1 region*; Al Anbar Al Basrah Al Muthanna Al Qadisiyah An Najaf Arbil As Sulaymaniyah At Ta'mim Babil Baghdad Dahuk Dhi Qar Diyala Karbala' Kurdistan Regional Government* Maysan Ninawa Salah ad Din Wasit,96.4,1997,42.7,2000,wheat barley rice vegetables dates cotton; cattle sheep poultry,Iraqi Armed Forces: Iraqi Army (includes Iraqi Special Operations Force Iraqi Intervention Force) Iraqi Navy (former Iraqi Coastal Defense Force) Iraqi Air Force (former Iraqi Army Air Corps) (2005),30.1,2009 est.,,,$ 42 400 000 000,FY08 est.,mostly desert; mild to cool winters with dry hot cloudless summers; northern mountainous regions along Iranian and Turkish borders experience cold winters with occasionally heavy snows that melt in early spring sometimes causing extensive flooding in central and southern Iraq,food medicine manufactures,Assyrian Democratic Movement [Yunadim KANNA]; Badr Organization [Hadi al-AMIRI]; Constitutional Monarchy Movement or CMM [Sharif Ali Bin al-HUSAYN]; Da'wa al-Islamiya Party [Nuri al-MALIKI]; General Conference of Iraqi People [Adnan al-DULAYMI]; Independent Iraqi Alliance or IIA [Falah al-NAQIB]; Iraqi Communist Party [Hamid MAJID]; Iraqi Front for National Dialogue [Salih al-MUTLAQ]; Iraqi Hizballah [Karim Mahmud al-MUHAMMADAWI]; Iraqi Independent Democrats or IID [Adnan PACHACHI Mahdi al-HAFIZ]; Iraqi Islamic Party or IIP [Tariq al-HASHIMI]; Iraqi National Accord or INA [Ayad ALLAWI]; Iraqi National Congress or INC [Ahmad CHALABI]; Iraqi National Council for Dialogue or INCD [Khalaf Ulayan al-Khalifawi al-DULAYMI]; Iraqi National Unity Movement or INUM [Ahmad al-KUBAYSI]; Islamic Action Organization or IAO [Ayatollah Muhammad al-MUDARRISI]; Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq or ISCI [Abd al-Aziz al-HAKIM]; Jama'at al Fadilah or JAF [Muhammad Ali al-YAQUBI]; Kurdistan Democratic Party or KDP [Masud BARZANI]; Kurdistan Islamic Union [Salah ad-Din Muhammad BAHA al-DIN]; Patriotic Union of Kurdistan or PUK [Jalal TALABANI]; Sadrist Trend [Muqtada al-SADR] (not an organized political party but it fields independent candidates affiliated with Muqtada al-SADR); Sahawa al-Iraq [Ahmad al-RISHAWI] note: the Kurdistan Alliance Iraqi National List Tawafuq Front Iraqi Front for National Dialogue and Unified Iraqi Alliance were only electoral slates consisting of the representatives from the various Iraqi political parties,28945657,July 2009 est.,noun: Iraqi(s) adjective: Iraqi,petroleum natural gas phosphates sulfur,,,strategic location on Shatt al Arab waterway and at the head of the Persian Gulf,Sunni militias; Shia militias some associated with political parties,Decreasing insurgent attacks and an improving security environment in many parts of the country are helping to spur economic activity. Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector which has traditionally provided over 90% of foreign exchange earnings. Oil exports are around levels seen before Operation Iraqi Freedom. Total government revenues have benefited from high oil prices in recent years; however revenues have declined significantly since the oil price drop in fall 2008. Iraq is making some progress in building the institutions needed to implement economic policy. In March 2009 Iraq concluded a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF that details economic reforms. The SBA allows an 80% reduction of the debt owed to Paris Club creditor nations. The International Compact with Iraq was established in May 2007 to integrate Iraq into the regional and global economy and the Iraqi government is seeking to pass laws to strengthen its economy. This legislation includes a hydrocarbon law to establish a modern legal framework to allow Iraq to develop its resources and a revenue sharing law to equitably divide oil revenues within the nation although both are still under contentious political negotiation. Some foreign entities have expressed interest in reinvigorating Iraq's industrial sector. The government of Iraq is pursuing a strategy to gain foreign participation in joint ventures with State-owned enterprises. Provincial Councils are also using their own budgets to promote and facilitate investment at the local level. The Central Bank has been successful in controlling inflation through appreciation of the dinar against the US dollar. However Iraq's challenge will be to use macroeconomic gains to improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis. Reducing corruption and implementing structural reforms such as bank restructuring and developing the private sector will be key to Iraq's economic success.,14021000,2007,3 October 1932 (from League of Nations mandate under British administration); note - on 28 June 2004 the Coalition Provisional Authority transferred sovereignty to the Iraqi-controlled Government,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,9454000000,2008 est.,3.0,NA,$ 14 050 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,2950000000.0,2008 est.,1.7,NA,,,,,6065009.0,2009 est.,Republic Day July 14 (1958); note - the Government of Iraq has yet to declare an official national holiday but still observes Republic Day,14,2008,0.0,NA,dust storms; sandstorms; floods,slightly more than twice the size of Idaho,74.1,2000 est.,69.94,2009 est.,unicameral Council of Representatives (consisting of 275 members elected by a closed-list proportional representation system) elections: last held 15 December 2005 to elect a 275-member Council of Representatives (next to be held January 2010); the Council of Representatives elected the Presidency Council and approved the prime minister and two deputy prime ministers election results: Council of Representatives - percent of vote by party - Unified Iraqi Alliance 41% Kurdistan Alliance 22% Tawafuq Coalition 15% Iraqi National List 8% Iraqi Front for National Dialogue 4% other 10%; number of seats by party (as of November 2007) - Unified Iraqi Alliance (including the Sadrist bloc with 30 and Fadilah with 15) 130 Kurdistan Alliance 53 Tawafuq Front 44 Iraqi National List 25 Fadilah 15 Iraqi Front for National Dialogue 11 other 12,based on European civil and Islamic law under the framework outlined in the Iraqi Constitution; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ABEDA AFESD (suspended) AMF CAEU FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC ISO ITSO ITU LAS MIGA NAM OAPEC OIC OPEC PCA UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO (observer),12.0,NA,6808954.0,2008 est.,8.6,2006,party to: Biodiversity Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection signed but not ratified: Environmental Modification,government water control projects have drained most of the inhabited marsh areas east of An Nasiriyah by drying up or diverting the feeder streams and rivers; a once sizable population of Marsh Arabs who inhabited these areas for thousands of years has been displaced; furthermore the destruction of the natural habitat poses serious threats to the area's wildlife populations; inadequate supplies of potable water; development of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers system contingent upon agreements with upstream riparian Turkey; air and water pollution; soil degradation (salination) and erosion; desertification,3.0,2008,5.0,2008,36920000000,2008 est.,2272,2008,Al Basrah Khawr az Zubayr Umm Qasr,18.0,NA,10.5,2008 est.,mostly broad plains; reedy marshes along Iranian border in south with large flooded areas; mountains along borders with Iran and Turkey,general assessment: the 2003 liberation of Iraq severely disrupted telecommunications throughout Iraq including international connections; widespread government efforts to rebuild domestic and international communications through fiber optic links are in progress; the mobile cellular market has expanded rapidly with an estimated 14 million current users in 2007 domestic: repairs to switches and lines destroyed during 2003 continue; additional switching capacity is improving access; cellular service is available and centered on 3 GSM networks which are being expanded beyond their regional roots improving country-wide connectivity; wireless local loop licenses have been issued with the hope of overcoming the lack of fixed-line infrastructure international: country code - 964; satellite earth stations - 4 (2 Intelsat - 1 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean 1 Intersputnik - Atlantic Ocean region and 1 Arabsat (inoperative)); local microwave radio relay connects border regions to Jordan Kuwait Syria and Turkey; planned international fiber-optic connections to Iran (terrestrial) with a link to the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) submarine fiber-optic cable (2007),3.86,2009 est.,18.2,2008 est.,parliamentary democracy,"three equal horizontal bands of red (top) white and black; the Takbir (Arabic expression meaning ""God is great"") in green Arabic script is centered in the white band; similar to the flag of Syria which has two stars but no script Yemen which has a plain white band and that of Egypt which has a gold Eagle of Saladin centered in the white band; design is based upon the Arab Liberation colors; Council of Representatives approved this flag as a compromise temporary replacement for Ba'athist Saddam-era flag",,$ 43 500 000 000,2008 est.,44900,2002,2.51,2009 est.,9.8,2008 est.,17.0,2007,$ 112 800 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Christopher R.

The total value of goods and services trade including the sizable share of reexports was equivalent to 404% of GDP in 2007. The territory has become increasingly integrated with mainland China over the past few years through trade tourism and financial links. The mainland has long been Hong Kong's largest trading partner accounting for nearly 49% of Hong Kong's exports trade by value in 2008. As a result of China's easing of travel restrictions the number of mainland tourists to the territory has surged from 4.5 million in 2001 to 16.9 million in 2008 when they outnumbered visitors from all other countries combined. Hong Kong has also established itself as the premier stock market for Chinese firms seeking to list abroad. More than one-third of the firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange are now mainland Chinese companies and they account for 60% of the Exchange's market capitalization. During the past decade as Hong Kong's manufacturing industry moved to the mainland its service industry has grown rapidly and now accounts for more than 90% of the territory's GDP. Hong Kong's natural resources are limited and food and raw materials must be imported. GDP growth averaged a strong 5% from 1989 to 2007 but the global financial crisis caused a sharp slowdown in the second half of 2008 pushing the territory into recession.

While it possesses substantial mineral agricultural and fishery resources its physical and social infrastructure is not well developed and serious social disorders continue to hamper economic development. Nearly half of the working-age population engages in subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Alluvial diamond mining remains the major source of hard currency earnings accounting for nearly half of Sierra Leone's exports. The fate of the economy depends upon the maintenance of domestic peace and the continued receipt of substantial aid from abroad which is essential to offset the severe trade imbalance and supplement government revenues. The IMF has completed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program that helped stabilize economic growth and reduce inflation.

The area came under Roman influence in the first centuries A.D. and Christianity became the state religion in the 330s. Domination by Persians Arabs and Turks was followed by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently the Ottoman and Persian empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian revolution it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. An attempt by the incumbent Georgian government to manipulate national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard SHEVARDNADZE president since 1995. New elections in early 2004 swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his National Movement party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has been made in the years since independence but this progress has been complicated by Russian assistance and support to the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. After a series of Russian and separatist provocations in summer 2008 Georgian military action in South Ossetia in early August led to a Russian military response that not only occupied the breakaway areas but large portions of Georgia proper as well. Russian troops pulled back from most occupied Georgian territory but in late August 2008 Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This action was strongly condemned by most of the world's nations and international organizations.,8.9,2006 est.,scrap metal wine mineral water ores vehicles fruits and nuts,20.41,31 December 2007,9.65,July 2009 est.,1253.0,2008,$ 13 280 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,9 regions (mkharebi singular - mkhare) 1 city (k'alak'i) and 2 autonomous republics (avtomnoy respubliki singular - avtom respublika) regions: Guria Imereti Kakheti Kvemo Kartli Mtskheta-Mtianeti Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti Samegrelo and Zemo Svaneti Samtskhe-Javakheti Shida Kartli city: Tbilisi autonomous republics: Abkhazia or Ap'khazet'is Avtonomiuri Respublika (Sokhumi) Ajaria or Acharis Avtonomiuri Respublika (Bat'umi) note: the administrative centers of the two autonomous republics are shown in parentheses,63.3,1997,3.61,2000,citrus grapes tea hazelnuts vegetables; livestock,Georgian Armed Forces: Land Forces Air and Air Defense Forces note: naval forces have been incorporated into the coast guard (2009),10.66,2009 est.,3.1,2006,$ 4 596 000 000,2008 est.,warm and pleasant; Mediterranean-like on Black Sea coast,fuels vehicles machinery and parts grain and other foods pharmaceuticals,Christian Democratic Movement [Giorgi TARGAMADZE]; Democratic Movement United Georgia [Nino BURJANADZE]; Georgian People's Front [Nodar NATADZE]; Georgian United Communist Party or UCPG [Panteleimon GIORGADZE]; Georgia's Way Party [Salome ZOURABICHVILI]; Greens [Giorgi GACHECHILADZE]; Industry Will Save Georgia (Industrialists) or IWSG [Georgi TOPADZE]; Labor Party [Shalva NATELASHVILI]; National Council-New Rights (bloc forming joint opposition) [Levan GACHECHILADZE]; National Democratic Party or NDP [Bachuki KARDAVA]; United National Movement [Mikheil SAAKASHVILI]; New Rights [David GAMKRELIDZE]; Republican Party [David USUPASHVILI]; Socialist Party or SPG [Irakli MINDELI]; Traditionalists [Akaki ASATIANI]; Union of National Forces-Conservatives [Koba DAVITASHVILI and Zviad DZIDZIGURI],4615807,July 2009 est.,noun: Georgian(s) adjective: Georgian,forests hydropower manganese deposits iron ore copper minor coal and oil deposits; coastal climate and soils allow for important tea and citrus growth,-4.26,2009 est.,strategically located east of the Black Sea; Georgia controls much of the Caucasus Mountains and the routes through them,separatists in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,Georgia's economy sustained GDP growth of close to 10% in 2006 and 12% in 2007 based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government spending. However growth slowed to less than 3% in 2008 and is expected to slow further in 2009. Georgia's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes citrus fruits and hazelnuts; mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages metals machinery aircraft and chemicals. Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction banking services and mining sectors but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks. The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products. It has sizeable hydropower capacity a growing component of its energy supplies. Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by bringing in newly available supplies from Azerbaijan. It also has an increased ability to pay for more expensive gas imports from Russia. The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on Georgia's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its role as a transit point for gas oil and other goods. Georgia has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues; however the government has made great progress and has reformed the tax code improved tax administration increased tax enforcement and cracked down on corruption since coming to power in 2004. Government revenues have increased nearly four fold since 2003. Due to improvements in customs and tax enforcement smuggling is a declining problem.

Unemployment is low and capacity constraints limit growth potential. Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus. The government has been successful in meeting and even exceeding the economic convergence criteria for participating in the third phase (a common European currency) of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) but so far Denmark has decided not to join 16 other EU members in the euro. Nonetheless the Danish krone remains pegged to the euro. Denmark's fiscal position is among the strongest in the EU. Economic growth gained momentum in 2004 and the upturn continued through 2006. After a long consumption-driven upswing Denmark's economy began slowing in early 2007 with the end of a housing boom. This cyclical slowdown has been exacerbated by the global financial crisis through increased borrowing costs and lower export demand consumer confidence and investment. The slowing global economy cut GDP by 0.6% in 2008.

In 1935 the Philippines became a self-governing commonwealth. Manuel QUEZON was elected president and was tasked with preparing the country for independence after a 10-year transition. In 1942 the islands fell under Japanese occupation during World War II and US forces and Filipinos fought together during 1944-45 to regain control. On 4 July 1946 the Republic of the Philippines attained its independence. The 20-year rule of Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986 when a ""people power"" movement in Manila (""EDSA 1"") forced him into exile and installed Corazon AQUINO as president. Her presidency was hampered by several coup attempts which prevented a return to full political stability and economic development. Fidel RAMOS was elected president in 1992 and his administration was marked by greater stability and progress on economic reforms. In 1992 the US closed its last military bases on the islands. Joseph ESTRADA was elected president in 1998 but was succeeded by his vice-president Gloria MACAPAGAL-ARROYO in January 2001 after ESTRADA's stormy impeachment trial on corruption charges broke down and another ""people power"" movement (""EDSA 2"") demanded his resignation. MACAPAGAL-ARROYO was elected to a six-year term as president in May 2004.

MACAPAGAL-ARROYO averted a fiscal crisis by pushing for new revenue measures and until recently tightening expenditures. Declining fiscal deficits tapering debt and debt service ratios and increased spending on infrastructure and social services bolstered optimism over Philippine economic prospects. Although the general macroeconomic outlook improved significantly in recent years the economy still faces several long term challenges. The Philippines must maintain the reform momentum in order to catch up with regional competitors improve employment opportunities and alleviate poverty. The Philippines will need still higher sustained growth to make progress in alleviating poverty given its high population growth and unequal distribution of income. The Philippine economy grew at its fastest pace in three decades in 2007 with real GDP growth exceeding 7% but growth slowed to 4.6% in 2008 as a result of the world financial crisis. High government spending a relatively small trade sector a resilient service sector and large remittances from the four- to five-million Filipinos who work abroad have helped cushion the economy from the current financial crisis.,51795000,2007,12 June 1898 (independence proclaimed from Spain); 4 July 1946 (from the US),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,2200000000,2006 est.,0.1,2000 census,$ 4 227 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007,3.0,NA,$ 65 660 000 000,31 December 2007,,,19169298.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 12 June (1898); note - 12 June 1898 was date of declaration of independence from Spain; 4 July 1946 was date of independence from US,391,2008,0.0,NA,astride typhoon belt usually affected by 15 and struck by five to six cyclonic storms per year; landslides; active volcanoes; destructive earthquakes; tsunamis,slightly larger than Arizona,92.6,2000 census,71.09,2009 est.,bicameral Congress or Kongreso consists of the Senate or Senado (24 seats - one-half elected every three years; members elected at large by popular vote to serve six-year terms) and the House of Representatives or Kapulungan Ng Nga Kinatawan (as a result of May 2007 election it has 240 seats including 218 members representing districts and 22 sectoral party-list members representing special minorities elected on the basis of 1 seat for every 2% of the total vote but limited to 3 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve three-year terms; note - the Constitution prohibits the House of Representatives from having more than 250 members) elections: Senate - last held on 14 May 2007 (next to be held in May 2010); House of Representatives - elections last held on 14 May 2007 (next to be held in May 2010) election results: Senate - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - Lakas 4 LP 4 Nacionalista 3 NPC 2 PDP-Laban 2 PMP 2 Kampi 1 LDP 1 PRP 1 independents 3; note - there are 23 rather than 24 sitting senators because one senator was elected mayor of Manila; House of Representatives - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - Lakas 92 Kampi 54 NPC 25 LP 21 Party-list 22 independents 3 others 26; there are 238 rather than 240 sitting representatives because two died in office,based on Spanish and Anglo-American law; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,ADB APEC APT ARF ASEAN BIS CP EAS FAO G-24 G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MINUSTAH NAM OAS (observer) OPCW PIF (partner) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO Union Latina UNMIL UNMIS UNMIT UNOCI UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,200.0,NA,23177487.0,2008 est.,0.9,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants,uncontrolled deforestation especially in watershed areas; soil erosion; air and water pollution in major urban centers; coral reef degradation; increasing pollution of coastal mangrove swamps that are important fish breeding grounds,4.0,2008,4.0,2008,56510000000,2007 est.,897,2008,Cagayan de Oro Cebu Davao Liman Manila Nasipit Harbor,18.0,NA,5.0,2008 est.,mostly mountains with narrow to extensive coastal lowlands,general assessment: good international radiotelephone and submarine cable services; domestic and interisland service adequate domestic: domestic satellite system with 11 earth stations; cellular communications now dominate the industry; combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone density about 60 telephones per 100 persons international: country code - 63; a series of submarine cables together provide connectivity to Asia US the Middle East and Europe; multiple international gateways (2007),3.27,2009 est.,7.4,2008 est.,republic,two equal horizontal bands of blue (top; representing peace and justice) and red (representing courage); a white equilateral triangle based on the hoist side represents equality; the center of the triangle displays a yellow sun with eight primary rays each representing one of the first eight provinces that sought independence from Spain; each corner of the triangle contains a small yellow five-pointed star representing the three major geographical divisions of the country: Luzon Visayas and Mindanao; the design of the flag dates to 1897; in wartime the flag is flown upside down with the red band at the top,domestic methamphetamine production has been a growing problem in recent years despite government crackdowns; major consumer of amphetamines; longstanding marijuana producer mainly in rural areas where Manila's control is limited,$ 60 780 000 000,2008 est.,201910,2008,1.96,2009 est.,4.6,2008 est.,2.0,2007,$ 320 600 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Kristie A.

Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy providing a major share of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually one of the highest rates in Africa. The government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings through oil-backed loans that have contributed to a growing debt burden and chronic revenue shortfalls. Economic reform efforts have been undertaken with the support of international organizations notably the World Bank and the IMF. However the reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO who returned to power when the war ended in October 1997 publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions. Economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998 which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty. Recovery of oil prices has boosted the economy's GDP and near-term prospects.

It enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result the economy depends heavily on agriculture featuring fruits vegetables wine and tobacco. Moldova must import almost all of its energy supplies. Moldova's dependence on Russian energy was underscored at the end of 2005 when a Russian-owned electrical station in Moldova's separatist Transnistria region cut off power to Moldova and Russia's Gazprom cut off natural gas in disputes over pricing and again in January 2009 during a similar dispute. Russia's decision to ban Moldovan wine and agricultural products coupled with its decision to double the price Moldova paid for Russian natural gas slowed GDP growth in 2006. However in 2007-08 growth returned to the 6% level Moldova had achieved in 2000-05 boosted by Russia's partial removal of the bans solid fixed capital investment and strong domestic demand driven by remittances from abroad. Economic reforms have been slow because of corruption and strong political forces backing government controls. Nevertheless the government's primary goal of EU integration has resulted in some market-oriented progress. The granting of EU trade preferences and increased exports to Russia will encourage higher growth rates but the agreements are unlikely to serve as a panacea given the extent to which export success depends on higher quality standards and other factors. The economy remains vulnerable to higher fuel prices poor agricultural weather and the skepticism of foreign investors. Also the presence of an illegal separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region continues to be a drag on the Moldovan economy. The deteriorating global economic crisis did not seriously effect the Moldovan economy in 2008 due to its low exposure to the international financial system but a global economic slowdown particularly in the EU and Russia could hurt the economy in 2009 as Moldova relies heavily on remittances from Moldovans abroad.,1883000,2007,27 August 1991 (from the Soviet Union),0,2007 est.,2440000000,2007 est.,2440000000,2007 est.,0.5,NA,$ -1 009 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,3741000000.0,2006 est.,-1.5,NA,$ 1 896 000 000,31 December 2007,,,877665.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 27 August (1991),39,2008,2.0,NA,landslides,slightly larger than Maryland,99.1,2005 est.,70.8,2009 est.,unicameral Parliament or Parlamentul (101 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 5 April 2009 (next to be held in 2013) election results: percent of vote by party - PCRM 49.5% PL 13.1% PLDM 12.4% AMN 9.8%; seats by party - PCRM 60 PL 15 PLDM 15 AMN 11,based on civil law system; Constitutional Court reviews legality of legislative acts and governmental decisions of resolution; accepts many UN and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) documents; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,BSEC CE CEI CIS EAEC (observer) EAPC EBRD FAO GCTU GUAM IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt (signatory) IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO (correspondent) ITU MIGA OIF OPCW OSCE PFP SECI UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO Union Latina UNMIL UNMIS UNOCI UNOMIG UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,,,1161924.0,2008 est.,0.4,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,heavy use of agricultural chemicals including banned pesticides such as DDT has contaminated soil and groundwater; extensive soil erosion from poor farming methods,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,3824000000,2006 est.,1138,2008,,18.0,NA,-1.0,2008 est.,rolling steppe gradual slope south to Black Sea,general assessment: inadequate outmoded poor service outside Chisinau; some modernization is under way domestic: depending on location new subscribers may face long wait for service; multiple private operators of GSM mobile-cellular telephone service are operating; GPRS system is being introduced; a CDMA mobile telephone network began operations in 2007; combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity 70 per 100 persons international: country code - 373; service through Romania and Russia via landline; satellite earth stations - at least 3 (Intelsat Eutelsat and Intersputnik) (2007),1.27,2009 est.,2.1,2007 est.,republic,three equal vertical bands of blue (hoist side) yellow and red; emblem in center of flag is of a Roman eagle of gold outlined in black with a red beak and talons carrying a yellow cross in its beak and a green olive branch in its right talons and a yellow scepter in its left talons; on its breast is a shield divided horizontally red over blue with a stylized ox head star rose and crescent all in black-outlined yellow; same color scheme as Romania,limited cultivation of opium poppy and cannabis mostly for CIS consumption; transshipment point for illicit drugs from Southwest Asia via Central Asia to Russia Western Europe and possibly the US; widespread crime and underground economic activity,$ 4 870 000 000,2008 est.,12666,2007,-0.08,2009 est.,7.3,2008,,,$ 10 630 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Asif CHAUDHRY embassy: 103 Mateevici Street Chisinau MD-2009 mailing address: use embassy street address telephone: [373] (22) 40-8300 FAX: [373] (22) 23-3044,$ 2 500,2008 est.,50000000,2006 est.

In the 16th century the Sa'adi monarchy particularly under Ahmad AL-MANSUR (1578-1603) repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age. In 1860 Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912 the French imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that same year. Morocco virtually annexed Western Sahara during the late 1970s but final resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved. Gradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature which first met in 1997. The country has made improvements in human rights under King MOHAMMED VI and its press is moderately free. Despite the continuing reforms ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch.,19.8,2006 est.,clothing and textiles electric components inorganic chemicals transistors crude minerals fertilizers (including phosphates) petroleum products citrus fruits vegetables fish,,,5.45,July 2009 est.,439.0,2008,$ 90 470 000 000,2008 est.,,,$ 887 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,15 regions; Grand Casablanca Chaouia-Ouardigha Doukkala-Abda Fes-Boulemane Gharb-Chrarda-Beni Hssen Guelmim-Es Smara Laayoune-Boujdour-Sakia El Hamra Marrakech-Tensift-Al Haouz Meknes-Tafilalet Oriental Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer Souss-Massa-Draa Tadla-Azilal Tanger-Tetouan Taza-Al Hoceima-Taounate note: Morocco claims the territory of Western Sahara the political status of which is considered undetermined by the US Government; portions of the regions Guelmim-Es Smara and Laayoune-Boujdour-Sakia El Hamra as claimed by Morocco lie within Western Sahara; Morocco also claims Oued Eddahab-Lagouira another region which falls entirely within Western Sahara,29.0,2003,12.6,2000,barley wheat citrus wine vegetables olives; livestock,Royal Armed Forces (Forces Armees Royales FAR): Royal Moroccan Army (includes Air Defense) Navy (includes Marines) Royal Moroccan Air Force (Al Quwwat al Jawyiya al Malakiya Marakishiya; Force Aerienne Royale Marocaine) (2008),20.96,2009 est.,,,$ 26 160 000 000,2008 est.,Mediterranean becoming more extreme in the interior,crude petroleum textile fabric telecommunications equipment wheat gas and electricity transistors plastics,Action Party or PA [Mohammed EL IDRISSI]; Al Ahd (The Covenant) Party [Najib EL OUAZZANI]; Alliance des Libert'es (Alliance of Liberty) or ADL [Ali BELHAJ]; An-Nahj Ad-Dimocrati or An-Nahj [Abdellah EL HARIF]; Authenticity and Modernity Party or PAM [Mohamed Cheikh BIADILLAH Secretary General]; Choura et Istiqlal (Consultation and Independence) Party or PCI [Abdelwahed MAACH]; Citizens' Forces or FC [Abderrahman LAHJOUJI]; Citizenship and Development Initiative or ICD [Mohamed BENHAMOU]; Constitutional Union Party or UC [Mohammed ABIED]; Democratic and Social Movement or MDS [Mahmoud ARCHANE]; Democratic Forces Front or FFD [Touhami EL KHIARI]; Democratic Socialist Vanguard Party or PADS [Ahmed BENJELLOUN]; Democratic Society Party or PSD [Zhor CHEKKAFI]; Democratic Union or UD [Bouazza IKKEN]; Environment and Development Party or PED [Ahmed EL ALAMI]; Istiqlal (Independence) Party or PI [Abbas EL FASSI]; Justice and Development Party or PJD [Abdelilah BENKIRANE]; Labor Party or PT [Abdelkrim BENATIK]; Moroccan Liberal Party or PML [Mohamed ZIANE]; National Democratic Party or PND [Abdallah KADIRI]; National Ittihadi Congress Party or CNI [Abdelmajid BOUZOUBAA]; National Popular Movement or MNP [Mahjoubi AHERDANE]; National Rally of Independents or RNI [Mustapha EL MANSOURI]; National Union of Popular Forces or UNFP [Abdellah IBRAHIM]; Popular Movement or MP [Mohamed LAENSER]; Progress and Socialism Party or PPS [Ismail ALAOUI]; Reform and Development Party or PRD [Abderrahmane EL KOUHEN]; Renaissance and Virtue Party or PRV [Mohamed KHALIDI]; Renewal and Equity Party or PRE [Chakir ACHABAR]; Social Center Party or PSC [Lahcen MADIH]; Socialist Democratic Party or PSD [Aissa OUARDIGHI]; Socialist Union of Popular Forces or USFP [Abdelwahed RADI]; Unified Socialist Left Party or PGSU [Mohamed Ben Said AIT IDDER],34859364,July 2009 est.,noun: Moroccan(s) adjective: Moroccan,phosphates iron ore manganese lead zinc fish salt,-0.72,2009 est.,strategic location along Strait of Gibraltar,Democratic Confederation of Labor or CDT [Noubir AMAOUI]; General Union of Moroccan Workers or UGTM [Abderrazzak AFILAL]; Moroccan Employers Association or CGEM [Hassan CHAMI]; National Labor Union of Morocco or UNMT [Abdelslam MAATI]; Union of Moroccan Workers or UMT [Mahjoub BENSEDDIK],Moroccan economic policies brought macroeconomic stability to the country in the early 1990s but have not spurred growth sufficient to reduce unemployment - nearing 20% in urban areas - despite the Moroccan Government's ongoing efforts to diversify the economy. Morocco's GDP growth rose to 5.9% in 2008 with the economy recovering from a drought in 2007 that severely reduced agricultural output and necessitated wheat imports at rising world prices. Moroccan authorities understand that reducing poverty and providing jobs are key to domestic security and development. In 2005 Morocco launched the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) a $2 billion social development plan to address poverty and unemployment and to improve the living conditions of the country's urban slums. Moroccan authorities are implementing reform efforts to open the economy to international investors. Despite structural adjustment programs supported by the IMF the World Bank and the Paris Club the dirham is only fully convertible for current account transactions. In 2000 Morocco entered an Association Agreement with the EU and in 2006 entered a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US. Long-term challenges include improving education and job prospects for Morocco's youth and closing the income gap between the rich and the poor which the government hopes to achieve by increasing tourist arrivals and boosting competitiveness in textiles.,20029000,2007,2 March 1956 (from France),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,60000000,2006 est.,0.2,NA,$ -4 822 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,1998000000.0,2006 est.,1.8,NA,$ 71 900 000 000,31 December 2007,,,7779589.0,2009 est.,Throne Day (accession of King MOHAMMED VI to the throne) 30 July (1999),35,2008,-55.0,NA,northern mountains geologically unstable and subject to earthquakes; periodic droughts,slightly larger than California,52.3,2004 census,71.8,2009 est.,bicameral Parliament consists of a Chamber of Counselors (or upper house) (270 seats; members elected indirectly by local councils professional organizations and labor syndicates for nine-year terms; one-third of the members are elected every three years) and Chamber of Representatives (or lower house) (325 seats; 295 members elected by multi-seat constituencies and 30 from national lists of women; members elected by popular vote for five-year terms) elections: Chamber of Counselors - last held 8 September 2006 (next to be held in 2009); Chamber of Representatives - last held 7 September 2007 (next to be held in 2012) election results: Chamber of Counselors - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PI 17 MP 14 RNI 13 USFP 11 UC 6 PND 4 PPS 4 Al Ahd 4 other 17; Chamber of Representatives - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PI 52 PJD 46 MP 41 RNI 39 USFP 38 UC 27 PPS 17 FFD 9 MDS 9 Al Ahd 8 other 39,based on Islamic law and French and Spanish civil law systems; judicial review of legislative acts in Constitutional Chamber of Supreme Court; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ABEDA AfDB AFESD AMF AMU EBRD FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAS MIGA MONUC NAM OAS (observer) OIC OIF OPCW OSCE (partner) PCA UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNOCI UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,9080830.0,2008 est.,5.0,2003 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: Environmental Modification,land degradation/desertification (soil erosion resulting from farming of marginal areas overgrazing destruction of vegetation); water supplies contaminated by raw sewage; siltation of reservoirs; oil pollution of coastal waters,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,21880000000,2006 est.,1907,2008,Agadir Casablanca Mohammedia Safi,18.0,NA,4.7,2008 est.,northern coast and interior are mountainous with large areas of bordering plateaus intermontane valleys and rich coastal plains,general assessment: modern system with all important capabilities; however density is low with only 7 fixed lines available for each 100 persons; mobile-cellular subscribership reached 60 per 100 persons in 2007 domestic: good system composed of open-wire lines cables and microwave radio relay links; Internet available but expensive; principal switching centers are Casablanca and Rabat; national network nearly 100% digital using fiber-optic links; improved rural service employs microwave radio relay international: country code - 212; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 optical telecommunications submarine cable that provides connectivity to Asia the Middle East and Europe; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) and 1 Arabsat; microwave radio relay to Gibraltar Spain and Western Sahara; coaxial cable and microwave radio relay to Algeria; participant in Medarabtel; fiber-optic cable link from Agadir to Algeria and Tunisia (2007),2.51,2009 est.,10.0,2008 est.,constitutional monarchy,red with a green pentacle (five-pointed linear star) known as Sulayman's (Solomon's) seal in the center of the flag; red and green are traditional colors in Arab flags although the use of red is more commonly associated with the Arab states of the Persian gulf; design dates to 1912,one of the world's largest producers of illicit hashish; shipments of hashish mostly directed to Western Europe; transit point for cocaine from South America destined for Western Europe; significant consumer of cannabis,$ 39 160 000 000,2008 est.,57625,2006,1.48,2009 est.,5.9,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 137 300 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador (vacant); Charge d'Affaires Robert P.

Since 2000 however Croatia's economic fortunes have begun to improve slowly with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4% and 6% led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation over the same period has remained tame and the currency the kuna stable. Nevertheless difficult problems still remain including a stubbornly high unemployment rate a growing trade deficit and uneven regional development. The state retains a large role in the economy as privatization efforts often meet stiff public and political resistance. While macroeconomic stabilization has largely been achieved structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians.

In 1980 a military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market economy and multiparty system VIEIRA's regime was characterized by the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In February 2000 a transitional government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president in transparent polling. In September 2003 after only three years in office YALA was ousted by the military in a bloodless coup and businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In 2005 former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to pursue economic development and national reconciliation.

Cashew crops have increased remarkably in recent years and the country now ranks fifth in cashew production. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along with small amounts of peanuts palm kernels and timber. Rice is the major crop and staple food. However intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and caused widespread damage to the economy in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in GDP that year with partial recovery in 1999-2002. Before the war trade reform and price liberalization were the most successful part of the country's structural adjustment program under IMF sponsorship. The tightening of monetary policy and the development of the private sector had also begun to reinvigorate the economy. Because of high costs the development of petroleum phosphate and other mineral resources is not a near-term prospect. Offshore oil prospecting is underway in several sectors but has not yet led to commercially viable crude deposits. The inequality of income distribution is one of the most extreme in the world. The government and international donors continue to work out plans to forward economic development from a lamentably low base. In December 2003 the World Bank IMF and UNDP were forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary support in the amount of $107 million for 2004 representing over 80% of the total national budget. Government drift and indecision however resulted in continued low growth in 2002-06.

Commercially viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in 1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers weak infrastructure and remoteness from international markets. Tourism provides more than one-fifth of GDP. Private sector initiatives and a financial sector are in the early stages of development.

In succeeding years other localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of 1848 subsequently modified in 1874 replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government. Switzerland's sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers and the country was not involved in either of the two World Wars. The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international organizations has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors.

Switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector led by financial services and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology knowledge-based production. The Swiss in recent years have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's to enhance their international competitiveness but some trade protectionism remains particularly for its small agricultural sector. Switzerland remains a safehaven for investors because it has maintained a degree of bank secrecy and has kept up the franc's long-term external value. The global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn could however put Switzerland in a recession in 2009 particularly as global export demand stalls. Switzerland's largest banks suffered significant losses in 2008 and the country's largest bank accepted a government rescue deal in late 2008.

The French settled Grenada in the 17th century established sugar estates and imported large numbers of African slaves. Britain took the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded sugar production. In the 19th century cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export crop; in the 20th century nutmeg became the leading export. In 1967 Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full independence was attained in 1974 making Grenada one of the smallest independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada was seized by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six days later the island was invaded by US forces and those of six other Caribbean nations which quickly captured the ringleaders and their hundreds of Cuban advisers. Free elections were reinstituted the following year and have continued since that time.

Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Emily (2005) severely damaged the agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa cultivation - which had been a key driver of economic growth. Grenada has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process. Public debt-to-GDP is nearly 110% leaving the THOMAS administration limited room to engage in public investments and social spending. Strong performances in construction and manufacturing together with the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry have also contributed to growth in national output; however economic growth will likely slow in 2009 because of the global economic slowdown's effects on tourism and remittances.,46200,2006,7 February 1974 (from the UK),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,13.8,NA,$ -138 000 000,2007 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,0.3,NA,$ 575 800 000,31 December 2007,,,20483.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 7 February (1974),,,0.0,NA,lies on edge of hurricane belt; hurricane season lasts from June to November,twice the size of Washington DC,96.0,2003 est.,65.95,2009 est.,bicameral Parliament consists of the Senate (13 seats 10 appointed by the government and 3 by the leader of the opposition) and the House of Representatives (15 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: last held on 8 July 2008 (next to be held in 2013) election results: House of Representatives - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - NDC 11 NNP 4,based on English common law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP C Caricom CDB FAO G-77 IBRD ICAO ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC ITU ITUC MIGA NAM OAS OECS OPANAL OPCW UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UPU WFTU WHO WIPO WTO,12.0,NA,27309.0,2008 est.,,,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,NA,,,1.0,2008,167200000,2006 est.,,,Saint George's,18.0,NA,,,volcanic in origin with central mountains,general assessment: automatic islandwide telephone system domestic: interisland VHF and UHF radiotelephone links international: country code - 1-473; landing point for the East Caribbean Fiber Optic System (ECFS) submarine cable with links to 13 other islands in the eastern Caribbean extending from the British Virgin Islands to Trinidad; SHF radiotelephone links to Trinidad and Tobago and Saint Vincent; VHF and UHF radio links to Trinidad,2.23,2009 est.,12.5,2000,parliamentary democracy and a Commonwealth realm,a rectangle divided diagonally into yellow triangles (top and bottom) and green triangles (hoist side and outer side) with a red border around the flag; there are seven yellow five-pointed stars with three centered in the top red border three centered in the bottom red border and one on a red disk superimposed at the center of the flag; there is also a symbolic nutmeg pod on the hoist-side triangle (Grenada is the world's second-largest producer of nutmeg after Indonesia); the seven stars represent the seven administrative divisions,small-scale cannabis cultivation; lesser transshipment point for marijuana and cocaine to US,$ 343 000 000,2006,1127,2000,0.47,2009 est.,3.7,2008 est.,,,$ 1 211 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: the US Ambassador to Barbados is accredited to Grenada embassy: Lance-aux-Epines Stretch Saint George's mailing address: P.

Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1992 and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border dispute. Guatemala and Belize are gearing up for a simultaneous referendum to determine if this dispute will go before the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy. Current concerns include an unsustainable foreign debt high unemployment growing involvement in the South American drug trade growing urban crime and increasing incidences of HIV/AIDS.,10.2,2007,sugar bananas citrus clothing fish products molasses wood crude oil,14.33,31 December 2007,5.8,July 2009 est.,,,$ 1 383 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,6 districts; Belize Cayo Corozal Orange Walk Stann Creek Toledo,18.6,2000,0.15,2000,bananas cacao citrus sugar; fish cultured shrimp; lumber; garments,Belize Defense Force (BDF): Army BDF Air Wing BDF Volunteer Guard (2009),27.33,2009 est.,5.3,2004,$ 347 000 000,2008 est.,tropical; very hot and humid; rainy season (May to November); dry season (February to May),machinery and transport equipment manufactured goods; fuels chemicals pharmaceuticals; food beverages tobacco,National Alliance for Belizean Rights or NABR; National Reform Party or NRP [Cornelius DUECK]; People's National Party or PNP [Wil MAHEIA]; People's United Party or PUP [John BRICENO]; United Democratic Party or UDP [Dean BARROW]; Vision Inspired by the People or VIP [Paul MORGAN]; We the People Reform Movement or WTP [Hipolito BAUTISTA],307899,July 2009 est.,noun: Belizean(s) adjective: Belizean,arable land potential timber fish hydropower,,,only country in Central America without a coastline on the North Pacific Ocean,Society for the Promotion of Education and Research or SPEAR [Gustavo PERERA]; Association of Concerned Belizeans or ACB [David VASQUEZ]; National Trade Union Congress of Belize or NTUC/B [Rene GOMEZ],In this small essentially private-enterprise economy tourism is the number one foreign exchange earner followed by exports of marine products citrus cane sugar bananas and garments. The government's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies initiated in September 1998 led to sturdy GDP growth averaging nearly 4% in 1999-2007 though growth slipped to 3.8% in 2008 as a result of the global slowdown natural disasters and the drop in the price of oil. Oil discoveries in 2006 bolstered the economic growth. Exploration efforts continue and a small increase in production is expected in 2009. Major concerns continue to be the sizable trade deficit and unsustainable foreign debt equivalent to nearly 70% of GDP. In February 2007 the government restructured nearly all of its public external commercial debt which helped reduce interest payments and relieve some of the country's liquidity concerns. A key short-term objective remains the reduction of poverty with the help of international donors.,118300,2007,21 September 1981 (from the UK),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,9.4,NA,$ -42 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,248400000.0,2005,3.1,NA,$ 877 600 000,31 December 2007,,,54732.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 21 September (1981),216,2008,0.0,NA,frequent devastating hurricanes (June to November) and coastal flooding (especially in south),slightly smaller than Massachusetts,76.9,2000 census,68.2,2009 est.,bicameral National Assembly consists of the Senate (12 seats; members appointed by the governor general - 6 on the advice of the prime minister 3 on the advice of the leader of the opposition and 1 each on the advice of the Belize Council of Churches and Evangelical Association of Churches the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Belize Better Business Bureau and the National Trade Union Congress and the Civil Society Steering Committee; to serve five-year terms) and the House of Representatives (31 seats; members are elected by direct popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: House of Representatives - last held 6 February 2008 (next to be held in 2013) election results: percent of vote by party - UDP 56.3% PUP 40.9%; seats by party - UDP 25 PUP 6,English law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP C Caricom CDB FAO G-77 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM ITU ITUC LAES MIGA NAM OAS OPANAL OPCW PCA RG SICA UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,72926.0,2008 est.,1.4,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,deforestation; water pollution from sewage industrial effluents agricultural runoff; solid and sewage waste disposal,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,213500000,2007 est.,,,Belize City Big Creek,18.0,NA,1.8,2008 est.,flat swampy coastal plain; low mountains in south,general assessment: above-average system; fixed-line teledensity of 12 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone density of about 40 per 100 persons domestic: trunk network depends primarily on microwave radio relay international: country code - 501; landing point for the Americas Region Caribbean Ring System (ARCOS-1) fiber-optic telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to South and Central America parts of the Caribbean and the US; satellite earth station - 8 (Intelsat - 2 unknown - 6) (2007),3.36,2009 est.,8.1,2007,parliamentary democracy and a Commonwealth realm,blue with a narrow red stripe along the top and the bottom edges; centered is a large white disk bearing the coat of arms; the coat of arms features a shield flanked by two workers in front of a mahogany tree with the related motto SUB UMBRA FLOREO (I Flourish in the Shade) on a scroll at the bottom all encircled by a green garland,transshipment point for cocaine; small-scale illicit producer of cannabis primarily for local consumption; offshore sector money-laundering activity related to narcotics trafficking and other crimes (2008),$ 740 000 000,2008 est.,3007,2006,2.15,2009 est.,3.8,2008 est.,,,$ 2 820 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador (vacant); Charge d'Affaires J.A.

A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy; for most of the next six decades repressive governments ran the country. In 1974 a left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms.

Over the past two decades successive governments have privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The country qualified for the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU member economies. Economic growth had been above the EU average for much of the 1990s but fell back in 2001-08. GDP per capita stands at roughly two-thirds of the EU-27 average. A poor educational system in particular has been an obstacle to greater productivity and growth. Portugal has been increasingly overshadowed by lower-cost producers in Central Europe and Asia as a target for foreign direct investment. The budget deficit surged to an all-time high of 6% of GDP in 2005 but the government reduced the deficit to 2.6% in 2007 - a year ahead of Portugal's targeted schedule. Nonetheless the government faces tough choices in its attempts to boost the economy which grew by 0.9% in 2008 while keeping the budget deficit within the euro-zone 3%-of-GDP ceiling.,13413000,2007,1143 (Kingdom of Portugal recognized); 5 October 1910 (republic proclaimed),0,2007 est.,4095000000,2007 est.,4112000000,2007 est.,0.3,2001 census,$ -29 600 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,8371.0,2007 est.,1.4,NA,$ 412 700 000 000,31 December 2007,,,2049032.0,2009 est.,Portugal Day (Dia de Portugal) 10 June (1580); note - also called Camoes Day the day that revered national poet Luis de Camoes (1524-80) died,117,2008,0.0,NA,Azores subject to severe earthquakes,slightly smaller than Indiana,93.3,2003 est.,78.21,2009 est.,unicameral Assembly of the Republic or Assembleia da Republica (230 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 20 February 2005 (next to be held in fall 2009) election results: percent of vote by party - PS 45.1% PSD 28.7% CDU 7.6% CDS/PP 7.3% BE 6.4% other 4.9%; seats by party - PS 121 PSD 75 CDU 14 CDS/PP 12 BE 8,based on civil law system; the Constitutional Tribunal reviews the constitutionality of legislation; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,ADB (nonregional member) AfDB (nonregional member) Australia Group BIS CE CERN CPLP EAPC EBRD EIB EMU ESA EU FAO IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IEA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAIA (observer) MIGA MINURCAT NAM (guest) NATO NEA NSG OAS (observer) OECD OPCW OSCE PCA Schengen Convention SECI (observer) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNIFIL Union Latina UNMIT UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WEU WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO ZC,12.0,NA,2498262.0,2008 est.,2.3,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds Environmental Modification,soil erosion; air pollution caused by industrial and vehicle emissions; water pollution especially in coastal areas,1.0,2008,5.0,2008,44830000000,2007 est.,2786,2008,Leixoes Lisbon Setubal Sines,18.0,NA,-2.2,2008 est.,mountainous north of the Tagus River rolling plains in south,general assessment: Portugal's telephone system has achieved a state-of-the-art network with broadband high-speed capabilities domestic: integrated network of coaxial cables open-wire microwave radio relay and domestic satellite earth stations international: country code - 351; a combination of submarine cables provide connectivity to Europe North and East Africa South Africa the Middle East Asia and the US; satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (2 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean) NA Eutelsat; tropospheric scatter to Azores (1998),1.49,2009 est.,7.6,2008 est.,republic; parliamentary democracy,two vertical bands of green (hoist side two-fifths) and red (three-fifths) with the Portuguese coat of arms centered on the dividing line,seizing record amounts of Latin American cocaine destined for Europe; a European gateway for Southwest Asian heroin; transshipment point for hashish from North Africa to Europe; consumer of Southwest Asian heroin,$ 87 830 000 000,2008 est.,82900,2005,0.28,2009 est.,0.2,2008 est.,,,$ 237 300 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Thomas F.

Estonia's successive governments have pursued a free market pro-business economic agenda and have wavered little in their commitment to pro-market reforms. Tallinn's priority has been to sustain high growth rates - on average 8% per year from 2003 to 2007. The economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications sectors and strong trade ties with Finland Sweden and Germany. The current government has pursued relatively sound fiscal policies resulting in balanced budgets and low public debt. Rapid growth however has made it difficult to keep inflation and large current-account deficits from soaring putting downward pressure on the country's currency. The government has not given up on adopting the euro but has repeatedly postponed its target date.

Claimed by Argentina but annexed by Brazil in 1821 Uruguay declared its independence four years later and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The administrations of President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century established widespread political social and economic reforms that established a statist tradition. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement named the Tupamaros launched in the late 1960s led Uruguay's president to cede control of the government to the military in 1973. By yearend the rebels had been crushed but the military continued to expand its hold over the government. Civilian rule was not restored until 1985. In 2004 the left-of-center Frente Amplio Coalition won national elections that effectively ended 170 years of political control previously held by the Colorado and Blanco parties.

After averaging growth of 5% annually during 1996-98 in 1999-2002 the economy suffered a major downturn stemming largely from the spillover effects of the economic problems of its large neighbors Argentina and Brazil. In 2001-02 Argentine citizens made massive withdrawals of dollars deposited in Uruguayan banks after bank deposits in Argentina were frozen which led to a plunge in the Uruguayan peso a banking crisis and a sharp economic contraction. Real GDP fell in four years by nearly 20% with 2002 the worst year. The unemployment rate rose inflation surged and the burden of external debt doubled. Financial assistance from the IMF helped stem the damage. Uruguay restructured its external debt in 2003 without asking creditors to accept a reduction on the principal.

About 75% of the population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood. Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts fish and hides. Reexport trade normally constitutes a major segment of economic activity but a 1999 government-imposed preshipment inspection plan and instability of the Gambian dalasi (currency) have drawn some of the reexport trade away from The Gambia. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity to Europe has made it one of the larger markets for tourism in West Africa. The government's 1998 seizure of the private peanut firm Alimenta eliminated the largest purchaser of Gambian groundnuts. Despite an announced program to begin privatizing key parastatals no plans have been made public that would indicate that the government intends to follow through on its promises.

This tiny country composed of a mainland portion plus five inhabited islands is one of the smallest on the African continent. President Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO has ruled the country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup. Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991 the 1996 and 2002 presidential elections - as well as the 1999 and 2004 legislative elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president exerts almost total control over the political system and has discouraged political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil production resulting in a massive increase in government revenue in recent years there have been few improvements in the population's living standards.,,,petroleum methanol timber cocoa,15.0,31 December 2007,9.49,July 2009 est.,38.0,2008,$ 20 160 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,7 provinces (provincias singular - provincia); Annobon Bioko Norte Bioko Sur Centro Sur Kie-Ntem Litoral Wele-Nzas,26.0,2001,0.11,2000,coffee cocoa rice yams cassava (tapioca) bananas palm oil nuts; livestock; timber,National Guard (Guardia Nacional (Army) with Coast Guard (Navy) and Air Wing) (2008),36.52,2009 est.,0.6,2003,$ 3 601 000 000,2008 est.,tropical; always hot humid,petroleum sector equipment other equipment,Convergence Party for Social Democracy or CPDS [Placido MICO Abogo]; Democratic Party for Equatorial Guinea or PDGE (ruling party) [Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO]; Electoral Coalition or EC; Party for Progress of Equatorial Guinea or PPGE [Severo MOTO]; Popular Action of Equatorial Guinea or APGE [Avelino MOCACHE]; Popular Union or UP,633441,July 2009 est.,noun: Equatorial Guinean(s) or Equatoguinean(s) adjective: Equatorial Guinean or Equatoguinean,petroleum natural gas timber gold bauxite diamonds tantalum sand and gravel clay,,,insular and continental regions widely separated,ASODEGUE (Madrid-based pressure group for democratic reform); Global Witness (anti-corruption),"The discovery and exploitation of large oil reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth in recent years. Forestry farming and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth (the government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture). A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. No longer eligible for concessional financing because of large oil revenues the government has been trying to agree on a ""shadow"" fiscal management program with the World Bank and IMF.

France granted this area independence in 1943. A lengthy civil war (1975-1990) devastated the country but Lebanon has since made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions. Under the Ta'if Accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese established a more equitable political system particularly by giving Muslims a greater voice in the political process while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the government. Since the end of the war Lebanon has conducted several successful elections. Most militias have been disbanded with the exception of Hizballah designated by the US State Department as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and Palestinian militant groups. During Lebanon's civil war the Arab League legitimized in the Ta'if Accord Syria's troop deployment numbering about 16 000 based mainly east of Beirut and in the Bekaa Valley. Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000 and the passage in September 2004 of UNSCR 1559 - a resolution calling for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and end its interference in Lebanese affairs - encouraged some Lebanese groups to demand that Syria withdraw its forces as well. The assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq HARIRI and 22 others in February 2005 led to massive demonstrations in Beirut against the Syrian presence (""the Cedar Revolution"") and Syria withdrew the remainder of its military forces in April 2005. In May-June 2005 Lebanon held its first legislative elections since the end of the civil war free of foreign interference handing a majority to the bloc led by Saad HARIRI the slain prime minister's son. In July 2006 Hizballah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers leading to a 34-day conflict with Israel in which approximately 1 200 Lebanese civilians were killed. UNSCR 1701 ended the war in August 2006 and Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) deployed throughout the country for the first time in decades charged with securing Lebanon's borders against weapons smuggling and maintaining a weapons-free zone in south Lebanon with the help of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The LAF in May-September 2007 battled Sunni extremist group Fatah al-Islam in the Nahr al-Barid Palestinian refugee camp winning a decisive victory but destroying the camp and displacing 30 000 Palestinian residents. Lebanese politicians in November 2007 were unable to agree on a successor to Emile LAHUD when he stepped down as president creating a political vacuum until the election of Army Commander Michel SULAYMAN in May 2008 and the formation of a new unity government in July 2008.",,,jewelry base metals chemicals miscellaneous consumer goods fruit and vegetables tobacco construction minerals electric power machinery and switchgear textile fibers paper,10.26,31 December 2007,6.03,July 2009 est.,43.0,2008,$ 28 020 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,6 governorates (mohafazat singular - mohafazah); Beqaa Beyrouth Liban-Nord Liban-Sud Mont-Liban Nabatiye note: two new governorates - Aakar and Baalbek-Hermel - have been legislated but not yet implemented,4.8,1997,1.38,2000,citrus grapes tomatoes apples vegetables potatoes olives tobacco; sheep goats,Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF): Army (includes Navy) Air Force (Al Quwwat al Jawwiya al Lubnaniya) (2009),17.1,2009 est.,2.7,2006,$ 6 998 000 000,2008 est.,Mediterranean; mild to cool wet winters with hot dry summers; Lebanon mountains experience heavy winter snows,petroleum products cars medicinal products clothing meat and live animals consumer goods paper textile fabrics tobacco electrical machinery and equipment chemicals,14 March Coalition: Democratic Gathering Bloc [Walid JUNBLATT leader of Progressive Socialist Party]; Democratic Left [Ilyas ATALLAH]; Democratic Renewal Movement [Nassib LAHUD]; Future Movement Bloc [Sa'ad HARIRI]; Kataeb Party [Amine GEMAYEL]; Lebanese Forces [Samir JA'JA]; Tripoli Independent Bloc 8 March Coalition: Development and Resistance Bloc [Nabih BERRI leader of Amal Movement]; Free Patriotic Movement [Michel AWN]; Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc [Mohammad RA'AD] (includes Hizballah Party [Hassan NASRALLAH]); Nasserite Popular Movement [Ussama SAAD]; Popular Bloc [Elias SKAFF]; Syrian Ba'th Party [Sayez SHUKR]; Syrian Social Nationalist Party [Ali QANSO] Independent: Metn Bloc [Michel MURR]; Tashnaq,4017095,July 2009 est.,noun: Lebanese (singular and plural) adjective: Lebanese,limestone iron ore salt water-surplus state in a water-deficit region arable land,,,Nahr el Litani is the only major river in Near East not crossing an international boundary; rugged terrain historically helped isolate protect and develop numerous factional groups based on religion clan and ethnicity,Hizballah military wing other: Palestinian militias; Maronite Christians; Sunnis and their militias; Shias and their militias,Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong laissez-faire commercial tradition. The government does not restrict foreign investment; however the investment climate suffers from red tape corruption arbitrary licensing decisions high taxes tariffs and fees archaic legislation and weak intellectual property rights. The Lebanese economy is service-oriented; main growth sectors include banking and tourism. The 1975-90 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's economic infrastructure cut national output by half and all but ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. In the years since Lebanon has rebuilt much of its war-torn physical and financial infrastructure by borrowing heavily - mostly from domestic banks. In an attempt to reduce the ballooning national debt the Rafiq HARIRI government in 2000 began an austerity program reining in government expenditures increasing revenue collection and passing legislation to privatize state enterprises but economic and financial reform initiatives stalled and public debt continued to grow despite receipt of more than $2 billion in bilateral assistance at the 2002 Paris II Donors Conference. The Israeli-Hizballah conflict in July-August 2006 caused an estimated $3.6 billion in infrastructure damage and prompted international donors to pledge nearly $1 billion in recovery and reconstruction assistance. Donors met again in January 2007 at the Paris III Donor Conference and pledged more than $7.5 billion to Lebanon for development projects and budget support conditioned on progress on Beirut's fiscal reform and privatization program. An 18-month political stalemate and sporadic sectarian and political violence hampered economic activity particularly tourism retail sales and investment until the new government was formed in July 2008. Political stability since the Doha Accord of May 2008 has helped to boost investment and tourism but economic growth is likely to slow in 2009 as a result of the global economic recession.,1260000,2007,22 November 1943 (from League of Nations mandate under French administration),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,1.3,NA,$ -3 023 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,929000000.0,2006 est.,1.2,NA,$ 45 510 000 000,31 December 2007,,,948765.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 22 November (1943),33,2008,0.0,NA,dust storms sandstorms,about 0.7 times the size of Connecticut,87.4,2003 est.,73.66,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly or Majlis Alnuwab (Arabic) or Assemblee Nationale (French) (128 seats; members elected by popular vote on the basis of sectarian proportional representation to serve four-year terms) elections: last held on 7 June 2009 (next to be held in 2013) election results: percent of vote by group - March 8 Coalition 54.7% March 14 Coalition 45.3%; seats by group - March 14 Coalition 71; March 8 Coalition 57,mixture of Ottoman law canon law Napoleonic code and civil law; no judicial review of legislative acts; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ABEDA ACCT AFESD AMF FAO G-24 G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IPU ISO ITSO ITU LAS MIGA NAM OAS (observer) OIC OIF PCA UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNRWA UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO (observer),12.0,NA,1106879.0,2008 est.,3.1,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: Environmental Modification Marine Life Conservation,deforestation; soil erosion; desertification; air pollution in Beirut from vehicular traffic and the burning of industrial wastes; pollution of coastal waters from raw sewage and oil spills,2.0,2008,1.0,2008,8764000000,2006 est.,401,2008,Beirut Tripoli,21.0,NA,,,narrow coastal plain; El Beqaa (Bekaa Valley) separates Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountains,general assessment: repair of the telecommunications system severely damaged during the civil war now complete domestic: two wireless networks provide good service; combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular subscribership 50 per 100 persons international: country code - 961; submarine cable links to Cyprus Egypt and Syria; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean and 1 Atlantic Ocean); coaxial cable to Syria (2007),1.85,2009 est.,9.2,2007 est.,republic,three horizontal bands consisting of red (top) white (middle double width) and red (bottom) with a green cedar tree centered in the white band,cannabis cultivation dramatically reduced to 2 500 hectares in 2002 despite continued significant cannabis consumption; opium poppy cultivation minimal; small amounts of Latin American cocaine and Southwest Asian heroin transit country on way to European markets and for Middle Eastern consumption; money laundering of drug proceeds fuels concern that extremists are benefiting from drug trafficking,$ 16 250 000 000,2008 est.,6970,2005,1.11,2009 est.,7.0,2008 est.,,,$ 44 070 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Michele J.

More than 60% of its population lives in densely populated rural communities. Uzbekistan is now the world's second-largest cotton exporter and fifth largest producer; it relies heavily on cotton production as the major source of export earnings and has come under increasing international criticism for the use of child labor in its annual cotton harvest. Other major export earners include gold natural gas and oil. Following independence in September 1991 the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and prices. While aware of the need to improve the investment climate the government still sponsors measures that often increase not decrease its control over business decisions. A sharp increase in the inequality of income distribution has hurt the lower ranks of society since independence. In 2003 the government accepted Article VIII obligations under the IMF providing for full currency convertibility. However strict currency controls and tightening of borders have lessened the effects of convertibility and have also led to some shortages that have further stifled economic activity. The Central Bank often delays or restricts convertibility especially for consumer goods. Potential investment by Russia and China in Uzbekistan's gas and oil industry as well as increased cooperation with South Korea in the realm of civil aviation may boost growth prospects. In November 2005 Russian President Vladimir PUTIN and Uzbekistan President KARIMOV signed an ""alliance "" which included provisions for economic and business cooperation. Russian businesses have shown increased interest in Uzbekistan especially in mining telecom and oil and gas. In 2006 Uzbekistan took steps to rejoin the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the Eurasian Economic Community (EurASEC) which it subsequently left in 2008 both organizations dominated by Russia.

Agitation for independence in the decades following World War I was finally successful in getting the French to recognize Tunisia as an independent state in 1956. The country's first president Habib BOURGUIBA established a strict one-party state. He dominated the country for 31 years repressing Islamic fundamentalism and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. In November 1987 BOURGUIBA was removed from office and replaced by Zine el Abidine BEN ALI in a bloodless coup. BEN ALI is currently serving his fourth consecutive five-year term as president; the next elections are scheduled for October 2009.

Governmental control of economic affairs while still heavy has gradually lessened over the past decade with increasing privatization simplification of the tax structure and a prudent approach to debt. Progressive social policies also have helped raise living conditions in Tunisia relative to the region. Real growth which averaged almost 5% over the past decade declined to 4.7% in 2008 and probably will decline further in 2009 because of economic contraction and slowing of import demand in Europe - Tunisia's largest export market. However development of non-textile manufacturing a recovery in agricultural production and strong growth in the services sector somewhat mitigated the economic effect of slowing exports. Tunisia will need to reach even higher growth levels to create sufficient employment opportunities for an already large number of unemployed as well as the growing population of university graduates. The challenges ahead include: privatizing industry liberalizing the investment code to increase foreign investment improving government efficiency reducing the trade deficit and reducing socioeconomic disparities in the impoverished south and west.,7842000,2007,20 March 1956 (from France),0,2007 est.,0,2005,3850000000,2006 est.,1.0,NA,$ -1 755 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,1.7,NA,$ 25 230 000 000,31 December 2007,,,2489651.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 20 March (1956); also the anniversary of BEN ALI's assumption of the presidency 7 November (1987),7,2008,-17.0,NA,NA,slightly larger than Georgia,74.3,2004 census,75.78,2009 est.,bicameral system consists of the Chamber of Deputies or Majlis al-Nuwaab (189 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) and the Chamber of Advisors (126 seats; 85 members elected by municipal counselors deputies mayors and professional associations and trade unions; 41 members are presidential appointees; members serve six-year terms) elections: Chamber of Deputies - last held on 24 October 2004 (next to be held in October 2009); Chamber of Advisors - last held on 3 July 2005 (next to be held in July 2011) election results: Chamber of Deputies - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - RCD 152 MDS 14 PUP 11 UDU 7 Al-Tajdid 3 PSL 2; Chamber of Advisors - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - RCD 71 (14 trade union seats vacant (due to boycott)),based on French civil law system and Islamic law; some judicial review of legislative acts in the Supreme Court in joint session; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ABEDA AfDB AFESD AMF AMU AU BSEC (observer) FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAS MIGA MONUC NAM OAPEC (suspended) OAS (observer) OIC OIF OPCW OSCE (partner) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNOCI UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,2912819.0,2008 est.,1.4,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: Marine Life Conservation,toxic and hazardous waste disposal is ineffective and poses health risks; water pollution from raw sewage; limited natural fresh water resources; deforestation; overgrazing; soil erosion; desertification,2.0,2008,2.0,2008,12650000000,2006 est.,2159,2008,Bizerte Gabes La Goulette Rades Sfax Skhira,18.0,NA,2.7,2008 est.,mountains in north; hot dry central plain; semiarid south merges into the Sahara,general assessment: above the African average and continuing to be upgraded; key centers are Sfax Sousse Bizerte and Tunis; Internet access available domestic: in an effort jumpstart expansion of the fixed-line network the government has awarded a concession to build and operate a VSAT network with international connectivity; competition between the two mobile-cellular service providers has resulted in lower activation and usage charges and a strong surge in subscribership; expansion of mobile-cellular services to include multimedia messaging and e-mail and Internet to mobile phone services also leading to a surge in subscribership; overall fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity is about 90 telephones per 100 persons international: country code - 216; a landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-4 submarine cable system that provides links to Europe Middle East and Asia; satellite earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) and 1 Arabsat; coaxial cable and microwave radio relay to Algeria and Libya; participant in Medarabtel; 2 international gateway digital switches,1.72,2009 est.,14.1,2008 est.,republic,red with a white disk in the center bearing a red crescent nearly encircling a red five-pointed star; the crescent and star are traditional symbols of Islam,,$ 23 230 000 000,2008 est.,19232,2004,0.98,2009 est.,4.7,2008 est.,,,$ 81 880 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Robert F.

Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among the Afars minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in 2001 following the conclusion of a peace accord between Afar rebels and the Issa-dominated government. In 1999 Djibouti's first multi-party presidential elections resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH; he was re-elected to a second and final term in 2005. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the mouth of the Red Sea and serves as an important transshipment location for goods entering and leaving the east African highlands. The present leadership favors close ties to France which maintains a significant military presence in the country but also has strong ties with the US.

Two-thirds of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables and most food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center. Imports and exports from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia represent 85% of port activity at Djibouti's container terminal. Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation is therefore heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment rate of nearly 60% in urban areas continues to be a major problem.

The economy experienced solid growth from 2003 to 2007 reaching over 12% in 2006 driven by a construction boom in hotels and housing associated with the Cricket World Cup. Growth dropped off in 2008 with the end of the boom. Tourism continues to dominate the economy accounting for nearly 60% of GDP and 40% of investment. The dual-island nation's agricultural production is focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply and a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding handicrafts and electronic components.

A four-decade long conflict between government forces and anti-government insurgent groups principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) heavily funded by the drug trade escalated during the 1990s. The insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to overthrow the government and violence has been decreasing since about 2002 but insurgents continue attacks against civilians and large areas of the countryside are under guerrilla influence or are contested by security forces. More than 31 000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006 and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) as a formal organization had ceased to function. In the wake of the paramilitary demobilization emerging criminal groups arose whose members include some former paramilitaries. The Colombian Government has stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the country and now has a presence in every one of its administrative departments. However neighboring countries worry about the violence spilling over their borders.,18.8,2005 est.,petroleum coffee coal nickel emeralds apparel bananas cut flowers,,,5.54,July 2009 est.,3383.0,2008,$ 249 800 000 000,2008 est.,$ 67 230 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,$ 13 080 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,32 departments (departamentos singular - departamento) and 1 capital district* (distrito capital); Amazonas Antioquia Arauca Atlantico Bogota* Bolivar Boyaca Caldas Caqueta Casanare Cauca Cesar Choco Cordoba Cundinamarca Guainia Guaviare Huila La Guajira Magdalena Meta Narino Norte de Santander Putumayo Quindio Risaralda San Andres y Providencia Santander Sucre Tolima Valle del Cauca Vaupes Vichada,2132.0,2000,10.71,2000,coffee cut flowers bananas rice tobacco corn sugarcane cocoa beans oilseed vegetables; forest products; shrimp,National Army (Ejercito Nacional) National Navy (Armada Nacional includes Naval Aviation Naval Infantry (Infanteria de Marina IM) and Coast Guard) Colombian Air Force (Fuerza Aerea de Colombia FAC) (2008),19.57,2009 est.,4.7,2006,$ 82 920 000 000,2008 est.,tropical along coast and eastern plains; cooler in highlands,industrial equipment transportation equipment consumer goods chemicals paper products fuels electricity,Colombian Conservative Party or PC [Efrain Jose CEPEDA Sarabia]; Alternative Democratic Pole or PDA [Carlos GAVIRIA Diaz]; Liberal Party or PL [Cesar GAVIRIA Trujillo]; Radical Change or CR [German VARGAS Lleras]; Social National Unity Party or U Party [Carlos FERRO Solanilla] note: Colombia has 15 formally recognized political parties and numerous unofficial parties that did not meet the vote threshold in the March 2006 legislative elections required for recognition,45644023,July 2009 est.,noun: Colombian(s) adjective: Colombian,petroleum natural gas coal iron ore nickel gold copper emeralds hydropower,-0.26,2009 est.,only South American country with coastlines on both the North Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea,National Liberation Army or ELN; Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC note: two largest insurgent groups active in Colombia,Colombia has experienced accelerating growth between 2002 and 2007 with expansion above 7% in 2007 chiefly due to advancements in domestic security to rising commodity prices and to President URIBE's promarket economic policies. Colombia's sustained growth helped reduce poverty by 20% and cut unemployment by 25% since 2002. Additionally investor friendly reforms to Colombia's hydrocarbon sector and the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (CTPA) negotiations have attracted record levels of foreign investment. Inequality underemployment and narcotrafficking remain significant challenges and Colombia's infrastructure requires significant updating in order to sustain expansion. Economic growth slipped in 2008 as a result of the global financial crisis and weakening demand for Colombia's exports. In response URIBE's administration has cut capital controls arranged for emergency credit lines from multilateral institutions and promoted investment incentives such as Colombia's modernized free trade zone mechanism legal stability contracts and new bilateral investment treaties and trade agreements. The government has also encouraged exporters to diversify their customer base away from the United States and Venezuela Colombia's largest trading partners. Nevertheless the business sector continues to be concerned about the impact of a global recession on Colombia's exports as well as the approval of the CTPA which is stalled in the US Congress.,33941000,2007,20 July 1810 (from Spain),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,7220000000,2006 est.,10.0,NA,$ -6 761 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,38400000.0,2007,1.7,NA,$ 85 340 000 000,31 December 2007,,,8212944.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 20 July (1810),17,2008,0.0,NA,highlands subject to volcanic eruptions; occasional earthquakes; periodic droughts,slightly less than twice the size of Texas,90.4,2005 census,72.81,2009 est.,bicameral Congress or Congreso consists of the Senate or Senado (102 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) and the House of Representatives or Camara de Representantes (166 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: Senate - last held 12 March 2006 (next to be held in March 2010); House of Representatives - last held 12 March 2006 (next to be held in March 2010) election results: Senate - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PSUN 20 PC 18 PL 18 CR 15 PDI 10 other parties 21; House of Representatives - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PL 35 PSUN 33 PC 29 CR 20 PDA 8 other parties 41,based on Spanish law; a new criminal code modeled after US procedures was enacted into law in 2004 and reached full implementation in January 2008; judicial review of executive and legislative acts; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,BCIE CAN Caricom (observer) CDB FAO G-3 G-24 G-77 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAES LAIA Mercosur (associate) MIGA NAM OAS OPANAL OPCW PCA RG UN UNASUR UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO Union Latina UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,11478109.0,2008 est.,3.4,2005 est.,party to: Antarctic Treaty Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands signed but not ratified: Law of the Sea,deforestation; soil and water quality damage from overuse of pesticides; air pollution especially in Bogota from vehicle emissions,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,53600000000,2007,3802,2008,Barranquilla Buenaventura Cartagena Santa Marta Turbo,18.0,NA,0.8,2008 est.,flat coastal lowlands central highlands high Andes Mountains eastern lowland plains,general assessment: modern system in many respects; telecommunications sector liberalized during the 1990s; multiple providers of both fixed-line and mobile-cellular services; fixed-line connections stand at about 18 per 100 persons; mobile cellular usage is about 75 per 100 persons; competition among cellular service providers is resulting in falling local and international calling rates and contributing to the steep decline in the market share of fixed line services domestic: nationwide microwave radio relay system; domestic satellite system with 41 earth stations; fiber-optic network linking 50 cities international: country code - 57; submarine cables provide links to the US parts of the Caribbean and Central and South America; satellite earth stations - 10 (6 Intelsat 1 Inmarsat 3 fully digitalized international switching centers) (2007),2.46,2009 est.,11.3,2008 est.,republic; executive branch dominates government structure,three horizontal bands of yellow (top double-width) blue and red note: similar to the flag of Ecuador which is longer and bears the Ecuadorian coat of arms superimposed in the center,illicit producer of coca opium poppy and cannabis; world's leading coca cultivator with 167 000 hectares in coca cultivation in 2007 a 6% increase over 2006 producing a potential of 535 mt of pure cocaine; the world's largest producer of coca derivatives; supplies cocaine to nearly all of the US market and the great majority of other international drug markets; in 2005 aerial eradication dispensed herbicide to treat over 130 000 hectares but aggressive replanting on the part of coca growers means Colombia remains a key producer; a significant portion of narcotics proceeds are either laundered or invested in Colombia through the black market peso exchange; important supplier of heroin to the US market; opium poppy cultivation is estimated to have fallen 25% between 2006 and 2007; most Colombian heroin is destined for the US market (2008),$ 37 560 000 000,2008 est.,164257,2005,1.38,2009 est.,3.5,2008 est.,2.0,2007,$ 399 400 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador William R.

The economy is predominantly agricultural with more than 90% of the population dependent on subsistence agriculture. Economic growth depends on coffee and tea exports which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability to pay for imports rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices. The Tutsi minority 14% of the population dominates the coffee trade. An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade resulted in more than 200 000 deaths forced more than 48 000 refugees into Tanzania and displaced 140 000 others internally. Only one in two children go to school and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food medicine and electricity remain in short supply. Burundi's GDP grew around 4% annually in 2006-08.

In keeping with this trend some large state-owned banks and industrial firms have been privatized. Exports have provided the primary impetus for industrialization. The island runs a large trade surplus and its foreign reserves are among the world's largest. Recently opened cross-strait travel transportation and tourism links are likely to increase Taiwan and China's economic interdependence.

Independence from Spain was declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in 1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the 19th century but gradually ceded control of the region in subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. Free elections in 1990 1996 and 2001 saw the Sandinistas defeated but voting in 2006 announced the return of former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA Saavedra. The 2008 municipal elections were characterized by widespread irregularities.

The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has been in effect since April 2006 and has expanded export opportunities for many agricultural and manufactured goods. Textiles and apparel account for nearly 60% of Nicaragua's exports but recent increases in the minimum wage will likely erode its comparative advantage in this industry. Nicaragua relies on international economic assistance to meet internal- and external-debt financing obligations. In early 2004 Nicaragua secured some $4.5 billion in foreign debt reduction under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and in October 2007 the IMF approved a new poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF) program. However severe budget shortfalls resulting from the suspension of large amounts of direct budget support from foreign donors concerned with recent political developments has caused a slowdown in PRGF disbursements. Similarly private sector concerns surrounding ORTEGA's handling of economic issues have dampened investment.

However in recent years the economy has diversified into light industry and tourism with about three-quarters of GDP and 80% of exports being attributed to services. Growth has rebounded since 2003 bolstered by increases in construction projects and tourism revenues reflecting its success in the higher-end segment but the sector will likely face declining revenues with the global economic downturn. The country enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes in the region. Offshore finance and information services are important foreign exchange earners and thrive from having the same time zone as eastern US financial centers and a relatively highly educated workforce. The government continues its efforts to reduce unemployment to encourage direct foreign investment and to privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. The public debt-to-GDP ratio of about 80% will likely widen as the THOMPSON administration engages in a more expansionary fiscal policy.,237100,2006,30 November 1966 (from the UK),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,29170000,2006 est.,4.2,2008 est.,$ -254 000 000,2007 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,1.5,NA,$ 3 533 000 000,31 December 2007,,,58596.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 30 November (1966),85,2008,0.0,NA,infrequent hurricanes; periodic landslides,2.5 times the size of Washington DC,99.7,2002 est.,73.94,2009 est.,bicameral Parliament consists of the Senate (21 seats; members appointed by the governor general - 12 on the advice of the Prime Minister 2 on the advice of the opposition leader and 7 at his discretion) and the House of Assembly (30 seats; members are elected by direct popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: House of Assembly - last held 15 January 2008 (next to be called in 2013) election results: House of Assembly - percent of vote by party - DLP 52.5% BLP 47.3%; seats by party - DLP 20 BLP 10,English common law; no judicial review of legislative acts; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,ACP C Caricom CDB FAO G-77 IADB IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAES MIGA NAM OAS OPANAL OPCW UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,75265.0,2008 est.,0.5,2006 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,pollution of coastal waters from waste disposal by ships; soil erosion; illegal solid waste disposal threatens contamination of aquifers,,,1.0,2008,1003000000,2007 est.,,,Bridgetown,18.0,NA,-3.2,2000 est.,relatively flat; rises gently to central highland region,general assessment: fixed-line teledensity of roughly 50 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone density of about 85 per 100 persons domestic: island-wide automatic telephone system international: country code - 1-246; landing point for the East Caribbean Fiber System (ECFS) submarine cable with links to 13 other islands in the eastern Caribbean extending from the British Virgin Islands to Trinidad; satellite earth stations - 1 (Intelsat -Atlantic Ocean); tropospheric scatter to Trinidad and Saint Lucia (2007),1.68,2009 est.,10.7,2003 est.,parliamentary democracy and a Commonwealth realm,three equal vertical bands of blue (hoist side) gold and blue with the head of a black trident centered on the gold band; the band colors represent the blue of the sea and sky and the gold of the beaches; the trident head represents independence and a break with the past (the colonial coat of arms contained a complete trident),one of many Caribbean transshipment points for narcotics bound for Europe and the US; offshore financial center,$ 1 586 000 000,2006,1600,2004,0.38,2009 est.,1.5,2008 est.,,,$ 5 466 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Mary M.

The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute first between Britain and Spain then between Britain and Argentina. The UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982.

In 1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falkland Islands' exclusive fishing zone. These license fees total more than $40 million per year which help support the island's health education and welfare system. Squid accounts for 75% of the fish taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. The islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the islands in 1993 and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of producing 500 000 barrels per day; to date no exploitable site has been identified. An agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential oil reserves. Tourism especially eco-tourism is increasing rapidly with about 30 000 visitors in 2001. Another large source of income is interest paid on money the government has in the bank.

This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level. Agriculture including fishing and forestry is a mainstay of the economy accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing 80% of the population. Exports of apparel have boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the US. Deforestation and erosion aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel are serious concerns. President RAVALOMANANA has worked aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political crisis which triggered a 12% drop in GDP that year.

An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.

The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises. Italy also has a sizable underground economy which by some estimates accounts for as much as 15% of GDP. These activities are most common within the agriculture construction and service sectors. Italy has moved slowly on implementing needed structural reforms such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labor market and over-generous pension system and these conditions will be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis. The Italian government is seeking to rein in government spending but the leadership faces a severe economic constraint: Italy's official debt remains above 100% of GDP and the fiscal deficit - 1.5% of GDP in 2007 - could approach 3% in 2009 as political pressure to stimulate the economy and the costs of servicing Italy's debt rise.

Under British influence a monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years later a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan annexed by the British formalized the annual subsidies the country received and defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations. A refugee issue of over 100 000 Bhutanese in Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of the refugees are housed in seven United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camps. In March 2005 King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the government's draft constitution - which would introduce major democratic reforms - and pledged to hold a national referendum for its approval. In December 2006 the King abdicated the throne to his son Jigme Khesar Namgyel WANGCHUCK in order to give him experience as head of state before the democratic transition. In early 2007 India and Bhutan renegotiated their treaty to allow Bhutan greater autonomy in conducting its foreign policy although Thimphu continues to coordinate policy decisions in this area with New Delhi. In July 2007 seven ministers of Bhutan's ten-member cabinet resigned to join the political process and the cabinet acted as a caretaker regime until democratic elections for seats to the country's first parliament were completed in March 2008.

Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's financial assistance. The industrial sector is technologically backward with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects such as road construction rely on Indian migrant labor. Model education social and environment programs are underway with support from multilateral development organizations. Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example the government in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector encourages visits by upscale environmentally conscientious tourists. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing trade labor and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.

Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars during most of the remainder of the 20th century. These conflicts were rooted in northern economic political and social domination of largely non-Muslim non-Arab southern Sudanese. The first civil war ended in 1972 but broke out again in 1983. The second war and famine-related effects resulted in more than four million people displaced and according to rebel estimates more than two million deaths over a period of two decades. Peace talks gained momentum in 2002-04 with the signing of several accords. The final North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed in January 2005 granted the southern rebels autonomy for six years. After which a referendum for independence is scheduled to be held. A separate conflict which broke out in the western region of Darfur in 2003 has displaced nearly two million people and caused an estimated 200 000 to 400 000 deaths. The UN took command of the Darfur peacekeeping operation from the African Union on 31 December 2007. As of early 2009 peacekeeping troops were struggling to stabilize the situation which has become increasingly regional in scope and has brought instability to eastern Chad and Sudanese incursions into the Central African Republic. Sudan also has faced large refugee influxes from neighboring countries primarily Ethiopia and Chad.

GDP growth registered more than 10% per year in 2006 and 2007. From 1997 to date Sudan has been working with the IMF to implement macroeconomic reforms including a managed float of the exchange rate. Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999. Agricultural production remains important because it employs 80% of the work force and contributes a third of GDP. The Darfur conflict the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years despite rapid rises in average per capita income.

Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. An insurgency led by Maoist extremists broke out in 1996. The ensuing ten-year civil war between insurgents and government forces witnessed the dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and assumption of absolute power by the king. Several weeks of mass protests in April 2006 were followed by several months of peace negotiations between the Maoists and government officials and culminated in a November 2006 peace accord and the promulgation of an interim constitution. Following a nation-wide election in April 2008 the newly formed Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a federal democratic republic and abolished the monarchy at its first meeting the following month.

Following riots in the capital Male in August 2004 the president and his government pledged to embark upon democratic reforms including a more representative political system and expanded political freedoms. Progress was sluggish however and many promised reforms were slow to be realized. Nonetheless political parties were legalized in 2005. In June 2008 a constituent assembly - termed the ""Special Majlis"" - finalized a new constitution which was ratified by the president in August. The first-ever presidential elections under a multi-candidate multi-party system were held in October 2008.

Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. Fishing is the second leading sector. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods must be imported. Industry which consists mainly of garment production boat building and handicrafts accounts for about 7% of GDP. The Maldivian Government began an economic reform program in 1989 initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the private sector. Subsequently it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign investment. Real GDP growth averaged over 7.5% per year for more than a decade. In late December 2004 a major tsunami left more than 100 dead 12 000 displaced and property damage exceeding $300 million. As a result of the tsunami the GDP contracted by about 4.6% in 2005. A rebound in tourism post-tsunami reconstruction and development of new resorts helped the economy recover quickly with GDP growth registering 18% in 2006. Growth slowed in 2007-08 but remained above 5% per year. The trade deficit expanded sharply as a result of high oil prices and imports of construction material. Government spending on social needs subsidies and civil servant salaries have created a large budget deficit and inflation has picked up sharply reaching nearly 13% in October 2008 due to high oil and food prices. Diversifying beyond tourism and fishing reforming public finance and increasing employment are the major challenges facing the government. Over the longer term Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of erosion and possible global warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the area is 1 meter or less above sea level.,317800,2007,26 July 1965 (from the UK),0,2008 est.,0,2008 est.,0,2008 est.,,,$ -638 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2008 est.,5.3,NA,$ 1 080 000 000,31 December 2007,,,82247.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 26 July (1965),29,2008,0.0,NA,low level of islands makes them sensitive to sea level rise,about 1.7 times the size of Washington DC,96.3,2000 census,73.97,2009 est.,unicameral People's Council or People's Majlis (77 seats; members elected by direct vote to serve five-year terms); note - the Majlis in February 2009 passed legislation that incresed the number of seats to 77 from 50 elections: last held 9 May 2009 (next to be held in 2014) election results: percent of vote - DRP 36.8% MDP 32.9 % PA 9.2% DQP 2.6% AP 1.3% independents 17.1%; seats by party - DRP 28 MDP 25 PA 7 DQP 2 AP 1 independents 13; note - one seat unfilled,based on Islamic law with admixtures of English common law primarily in commercial matters; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB C CP FAO G-77 IBRD ICAO IDA IDB IFAD IFC IMF IMO Interpol IOC IPU ITU MIGA NAM OIC OPCW SAARC SACEP UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,85745.0,2008 est.,5.5,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,depletion of freshwater aquifers threatens water supplies; global warming and sea level rise; coral reef bleaching,2.0,2008,1.0,2008,270000000,2007 est.,,,Male,21.0,NA,-0.9,2004 est.,flat with white sandy beaches,general assessment: telephone services have improved; each island now has at least 1 public telephone and there are mobile cellular networks with a rapidly expanding subscribership approaching 90 per 100 persons domestic: interatoll communication through microwave links; all inhabited islands and resorts are connected with telephone and fax service international: country code - 960; linked to international submarine cable Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG); satellite earth station - 3 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) (2007),1.9,2009 est.,14.4,2006 est.,republic,red with a large green rectangle in the center bearing a vertical white crescent; the closed side of the crescent is on the hoist side of the flag,,$ 1 276 000 000,2008 est.,88,2006,-0.17,2009 est.,5.7,2008 est.,,,$ 1 738 000 000,2008 est.,the US does not have an embassy in Maldives; the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Ambassador Robert O.

In 1990 the military overthrew the civilian leadership but a democratically elected government - a four-party New Front coalition - returned to power in 1991 and has ruled since; the coalition expanded to eight parties in 2005.,8.0,2004,alumina gold crude oil lumber shrimp and fish rice bananas,9.71,31 December 2007,5.51,July 2009 est.,50.0,2008,$ 2 984 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,10 districts (distrikten singular - distrikt); Brokopondo Commewijne Coronie Marowijne Nickerie Para Paramaribo Saramacca Sipaliwini Wanica,122.0,2003,0.67,2000,paddy rice bananas palm kernels coconuts plantains peanuts; beef chickens; shrimp; forest products,National Army (Nationaal Leger NL; includes Naval Wing Air Wing) (2007),16.8,2009 est.,,,$ 392 600 000,2004,tropical; moderated by trade winds,capital equipment petroleum foodstuffs cotton consumer goods,Alternative-1 or A-1 (a coalition of Amazone Party of Suriname or APS [Kenneth VAN GENDEREN] Democrats of the 21st Century or D-21 [Soewarto MOESTADJA] Nieuw Suriname or NS [Radjen Nanan PANDAY] Political Wing of the FAL or PVF [Jiwan SITAL] Trefpunt 2000 or T-2000 [Arti JESSURUN]); General Interior Development Party or ABOP [Ronnie BRUNSWIJK]; National Democratic Party or NDP [Desire BOUTERSE]; New Front for Democracy and Development or NF (a coalition that includes A-Combination or A-Com Democratic Alternative 1991 or DA-91 an independent business-oriented party [Winston JESSURUN] National Party Suriname or NPS [Ronald VENETIAAN] United Reform Party or VHP [Ramdien SARDJOE] Pertjaja Luhur or PL [Salam Paul SOMOHARDJO] Surinamese Labor Party or SPA [Siegfried GILDS]); Party for Democracy and Development in Unity or DOE [Marten SCHALKWIJK]; People's Alliance for Progress or VVV (a coalition of Democratic National Platform 2000 or DNP-2000 [Jules WIJDENBOSCH] Grassroots Party for Renewal and Democracy or BVD [Tjan GOBARDHAN] Party for National Unity and Solidarity of the Highest Order or KTPI [Willy SOEMITA] Party for Progression Justice and Perseverance or PPRS [Renee KAIMAN] Pendawalima or PL [Raymond SAPOEN]); Progressive Laborers and Farmers Union or PALU [Jim HOK]; Progressive Political Party or PPP [Surinder MUNGRA]; Seeka [Paul ABENA]; Union of Progressive Surinamers or UPS [Sheoradj PANDAY],481267,July 2009 est.,noun: Surinamer(s) adjective: Surinamese,timber hydropower fish kaolin shrimp bauxite gold and small amounts of nickel copper platinum iron ore,-0.26,2009 est.,smallest independent country on South American continent; mostly tropical rain forest; great diversity of flora and fauna that for the most part is increasingly threatened by new development; relatively small population mostly along the coast,Association of Indigenous Village Chiefs [Ricardo PANE]; Association of Saramaccan Authorities or Maroon [Head Captain WASE]; Women's Parliament Forum or PVF [Iris GILLIAD],The economy is dominated by the mining industry with exports of alumina gold and oil accounting for about 85% of exports and 25% of government revenues making the economy highly vulnerable to mineral price volatility. Prospects for local onshore oil production are good and a drilling program is underway. Offshore oil drilling was given a boost in 2004 when the State Oil Company (Staatsolie) signed exploration agreements with several Western oil companies. Bidding on these new offshore blocks was completed in July 2006. The short-term economic outlook depends on the government's ability to control inflation and on the development of projects in the bauxite and gold mining sectors though investment in these projects may slow with the tightening of global credit markets. Suriname has received aid for these projects from Netherlands Belgium and the European Development Fund. Suriname's economic prospects for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition. In 2000 the government of Ronald VENETIAAN returned to office and inherited an economy with inflation of over 100% and a growing fiscal deficit. He quickly implemented an austerity program raised taxes attempted to control spending and tamed inflation. The VENETIAAN administration also has created a stabilization fund to insulate future revenue from commodity shocks. These economic policies are likely to remain in effect during VENETIAAN's third term.,320000,2006,25 November 1975 (from the Netherlands),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,5.0,NA,$ 24 000 000,2007 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,1.0,NA,$ 651 000 000,31 December 2007,,,107367.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 25 November (1975),1,2008,-2.0,NA,NA,slightly larger than Georgia,89.6,2004 census,73.73,2009 est.,unicameral National Assembly or Nationale Assemblee (51 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: last held on 25 May 2005 (next to be held in 2010) election results: percent of vote by party - NF 39.7% NDP 22.2% VVV 13.8% A-Com 7.2% A-1 5.9% other 11.2%; seats by party - NF 23 NDP 15 VVV 5 A-Com 5 A-1 3,based on Dutch legal system incorporating French penal theory; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,ACP Caricom FAO G-77 IADB IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDB IFAD IFRCS IHO (suspended) ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IPU ISO (subscriber) ITU ITUC LAES MIGA NAM OAS OIC OPANAL OPCW PCA UN UNASUR UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UPU WCL WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,130243.0,2008 est.,0.6,2006 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,deforestation as timber is cut for export; pollution of inland waterways by small-scale mining activities,5.0,2008,1.0,2008,1595000000,2006 est.,,,Paramaribo Wageningen,18.0,NA,6.5,1994 est.,mostly rolling hills; narrow coastal plain with swamps,general assessment: international facilities are good domestic: combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity about 90 telephones per 100 persons; microwave radio relay network international: country code - 597; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean),1.99,2009 est.,9.5,2004,constitutional democracy,five horizontal bands of green (top double width) white red (quadruple width) white and green (double width); there is a large yellow five-pointed star centered in the red band,growing transshipment point for South American drugs destined for Europe via the Netherlands and Brazil; transshipment point for arms-for-drugs dealing,$ 1 297 000 000,2006 est.,4304,2003,1.1,2009 est.,6.0,2008 est.,,,$ 4 256 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Lisa Bobbie SCHREIBER HUGHES embassy: Dr. Sophie Redmondstraat 129 Paramaribo mailing address: US Department of State PO Box 1821 Paramaribo telephone: [597] 472-900 FAX: [597] 410-025,$ 8 900,2008 est.,0,2007 est.

A nationwide strike between December 2002 and February 2003 had far-reaching economic consequences - real GDP declined by around 9% in 2002 and 8% in 2003 - but economic output since then has recovered strongly. Fueled by high oil prices record government spending helped to boost GDP by about 9% in 2006 8% in 2007 and nearly 6% in 2008. This spending combined with recent minimum wage hikes and improved access to domestic credit has created a consumption boom but has come at the cost of higher inflation - roughly 20% in 2007 and more than 30% in 2008. Imports also have jumped significantly. Declining oil prices in the latter part of 2008 are expected to undermine the govenment's ability to continue the high rate of spending.

After failing in the Korean War (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed Republic of Korea (ROK) in the southern portion by force North Korea (DPRK) under its founder President KIM Il Sung adopted a policy of ostensible diplomatic and economic ""self-reliance"" as a check against outside influence. The DPRK demonized the US as the ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded propaganda and molded political economic and military policies around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of Korea under Pyongyang's control.

Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of years of underinvestment and shortages of spare parts. Large-scale military spending draws off resources needed for investment and civilian consumption. Industrial and power output have declined in parallel from pre-1990 levels. Severe flooding in the summer of 2007 aggravated chronic food shortages caused by on-going systemic problems including a lack of arable land collective farming practices and persistent shortages of tractors and fuel. Large-scale international food aid deliveries have allowed the people of North Korea to escape widespread starvation since famine threatened in 1995 but the population continues to suffer from prolonged malnutrition and poor living conditions. Since 2002 the government has allowed private ""farmers' markets"" to begin selling a wider range of goods. It also permitted some private farming - on an experimental basis - in an effort to boost agricultural output. In October 2005 the government tried to reverse some of these policies by forbidding private sales of grains and reinstituting a centralized food rationing system. By December 2005 the government terminated most international humanitarian assistance operations in North Korea (calling instead for developmental assistance only) and restricted the activities of remaining international and non-governmental aid organizations such as the World Food Program. External food aid now comes primarily from China and South Korea in the form of grants and long-term concessional loans. In May 2008 the US agreed to give 500 000 metric tons of food to North Korea via the World Food Program and US nongovernmental organizations; Pyongyang began receiving these shipments in mid-2008.

Subsequently the Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions between the two sides. The territories Israel occupied since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country profile unless otherwise noted. On 25 April 1982 Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991 bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent settlement. Israel and Palestinian officials signed on 13 September 1993 a Declaration of Principles (also known as the ""Oslo Accords"") guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. In addition on 25 May 2000 Israel withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon which it had occupied since 1982. In April 2003 US President BUSH working in conjunction with the EU UN and Russia - the ""Quartet"" - took the lead in laying out a roadmap to a final settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the two parties leading to two states Israel and a democratic Palestine. However progress toward a permanent status agreement was undermined by Israeli-Palestinian violence between September 2003 and February 2005. An Israeli-Palestinian agreement reached at Sharm al-Sheikh in February 2005 along with an internally-brokered Palestinian cease-fire significantly reduced the violence. In the summer of 2005 Israel unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip evacuating settlers and its military while retaining control over most points of entry into the Gaza Strip. The election of HAMAS in January 2006 to head the Palestinian Legislative Council froze relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Ehud OLMERT became prime minister in March 2006; he shelved plans to unilaterally evacuate from most of the West Bank following an Israeli military operation in Gaza in June-July 2006 and a 34-day conflict with Hizballah in Lebanon in June-August 2006. OLMERT in June 2007 resumed talks with the PA after HAMAS seized control of the Gaza Strip and PA President Mahmoud ABBAS formed a new government without HAMAS. OLMERT in September 2008 resigned in the wake of several corruption allegations but remained prime minister until the new coalition government under former Prime Minister Binyamin NETANYAHU was completed in late March 2009 following the February general election.",2.0,30 September 2008,machinery and equipment software cut diamonds agricultural products chemicals textiles and apparel,6.27,31 December 2007,5.43,July 2009 est.,176.0,2008,$ 188 700 000 000,2008 est.,$ 56 930 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,$ 54 550 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,6 districts (mehozot singular - mehoz); Central Haifa Jerusalem Northern Southern Tel Aviv,1.7,2001,2.05,2000,citrus vegetables cotton; beef poultry dairy products,Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Israel Naval Forces (INF) Israel Air Force (IAF) (2007),19.77,2009 est.,6.9,2004,$ 59 980 000 000,2008 est.,temperate; hot and dry in southern and eastern desert areas,raw materials military equipment investment goods rough diamonds fuels grain consumer goods,"Balad [Azmi BISHARA]; Democratic Front for Peace and Equality (HADASH) [Muhammad BARAKEH]; Kadima [Tzipora ""Tzipi"" LIVNI]; Labor Party [Ehud BARAK]; Likud [Binyamin NETANYAHU]; National Union [Yaakov KATZ]; The Jewish Home (HaBayit HaYehudi) [Daniel HERSCHKOWITZ]; SHAS [Eliyahu YISHAI]; The New Movement-Meretz [Haim ORON]; United Arab List-Ta'al [Ibrahim SARSUR]; United Torah Judaism or UTJ [Yaakov LITZMAN]; Yisrael Beiteinu or YB [Avigdor LIEBERMAN]",7233701,July 2009 est.,noun: Israeli(s) adjective: Israeli,timber potash copper ore natural gas phosphate rock magnesium bromide clays sand,2.37,2009 est.,there are about 340 Israeli civilian sites - including 100 small outpost communities in the West Bank - as well as 42 sites in the Golan Heights 0 in the Gaza Strip and 29 in East Jerusalem (July 2008 est.); Lake Tiberias (Sea of Galilee) is an important freshwater source,B'Tselem [Jessica MONTELL Executive Director] monitors human rights abuses; Peace Now [Yariv OPPENHEIMER Secretary General] supports territorial concessions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; YESHA Council of Settlements [Danny DAYAN Chairman] promotes settler interests and opposes territorial compromise,Israel has a technologically advanced market economy with substantial though diminishing government participation. It depends on imports of crude oil grains raw materials and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Israel imports substantial quantities of grain but is largely self-sufficient in other agricultural products. Cut diamonds high-technology equipment and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt is owed to the US its major source of economic and military aid. Israel's GDP after contracting slightly in 2001 and 2002 due to the Palestinian conflict and troubles in the high-technology sector has grown by about 5% per year since 2003. The economy grew an estimated 3.9% in 2008 slowed by the global financial crisis.

Tourism together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half of the archipelago's labor force. Steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels resorts and residences had led to solid GDP growth in recent years but tourist arrivals have been on the decline since 2006 and will likely drop even further in 2009. Tourism in turn depends on growth in the US the source of more than 80% of the visitors. To help offset the effect of the global economic downturn particularly on employment the INGRAHAM administration plans to engage in infrastructure projects. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy and when combined with business services account for about 36% of GDP.

Prior to the 2008 crisis Iceland had achieved high growth low unemployment and a remarkably even distribution of income. Government economic priorities have included stabilizing the krona reducing the current account deficit containing inflation restructuring the financial sector and diversifying the economy. The economy depends heavily on the fishing industry which provides 40% of export earnings and employs 5% of the work force. It remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products aluminum and ferrosilicon. Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade with new developments in software production biotechnology and tourism. Abundant geothermal sources have attracted substantial foreign investment in the aluminum and hydropower sectors and boosted economic growth although the financial crisis has put several investment projects on hold. Much of Iceland's economic growth in recent years came as the result of a boom in domestic demand following the rapid expansion of the country's financial sector. Domestic banks expanded aggressively in foreign markets and consumers and businesses borrowed heavily in foreign-currency loans following the privatization of the sector in the early 2000s. Worsening global financial conditions throughout 2008 resulted in a sharp depreciation of the krona vis-a-vis other major currencies. The foreign exposure of Icelandic banks whose loans and other assets totaled more than 10 times the country's GDP became unsustainable. Iceland's three largest banks collapsed in late 2008. The country negotiated over $10 billion in loans from the IMF and other countries to stabilize its currency and financial sector and to guarantee foreign deposits in Icelandic banks. A protracted recession is expected in 2009 and 2010 with GDP likely to contract and unemployment likely to surpass 10%. The collapse of the financial system has led to a major shift in opinion in favor of joining the EU and adopting the euro. Previous opposition to this move stemmed from Icelanders' concern about losing control of their fishing resources. Iceland's coalition government collapsed in January 2009 following protests over growing joblessness and losses to personal savings.,347500,2007,1 December 1918 (became a sovereign state under the Danish Crown); 17 June 1944 (from Denmark),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,1.6,2006 est.,$ -1 782 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,0.8,NA,$ 49 670 000 000,31 December 2006,,,61159.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 17 June (1944),2,2008,0.0,NA,earthquakes and volcanic activity,slightly smaller than Kentucky,99.0,2003 est.,80.67,2009 est.,unicameral Parliament or Althing (63 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 25 April 2009 (next to be held in 2013) election results: percent of vote by party - Social Democratic Alliance 29.8% Independence Party 23.7% Left-Green Movement 21.7% Progressive Party 14.8% Citizens' Movement 7.2% other 2.8%; seats by party - Social Democratic Alliance 20 Independence Party 16 Left-Green Alliance 14 Progressive Party 9 Citizens' Movement 4,civil law system based on Danish law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,Arctic Council Australia Group BIS CBSS CE EAPC EBRD EFTA FAO IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA NATO NC NEA NIB OAS (observer) OECD OPCW OSCE PCA Schengen Convention UN UNCTAD UNESCO UPU WCO WEU (associate) WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,74896.0,2008 est.,0.0,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Kyoto Protocol Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Transboundary Air Pollution Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: Environmental Modification Marine Life Conservation,water pollution from fertilizer runoff; inadequate wastewater treatment,3.0,2008,1.0,2008,11710000000,2007 est.,,,Grundartangi Hafnarfjordur Reykjavik,18.0,NA,0.0,2008 est.,mostly plateau interspersed with mountain peaks icefields; coast deeply indented by bays and fiords,general assessment: telecommunications infrastructure is modern and fully digitized with satellite-earth stations fiber-optic cables and an extensive broadband network domestic: liberalization of the telecommunications sector beginning in the late 1990s has led to increased competition especially in the mobile services segment of the market international: country code - 354; the CANTAT-3 and FARICE-1 submarine cable systems provide connectivity to Canada the Faroe Islands UK Denmark and Germany; a planned new section of the Hibernia-Atlantic submarine cable will provide additional connectivity to Canada US and Ireland; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note - Iceland shares the Inmarsat earth station with the other Nordic countries (Denmark Finland Norway and Sweden),1.9,2009 est.,1.6,2008 est.,constitutional republic,blue with a red cross outlined in white extending to the edges of the flag; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side in the style of the Dannebrog (Danish flag),,$ 5 782 000 000,2008 est.,13058,2007,0.74,2009 est.,-3.5,2008 est.,,,$ 12 150 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Hjalmar HANNESSON embassy: Laufasvegur 21 101 Reykjavik mailing address: US Department of State 5640 Reykjavik Place Washington D.C. 20521-5640 telephone: [354] 562-9100 FAX: [354] 562-9118,$ 39 900,2008 est.,0,2007 est.

During the 1920s and 1930s advances in mining spurred development and immigration. The name was changed to Zambia upon independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s declining copper prices and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991 brought an end to one-party rule but the subsequent vote in 1996 saw blatant harassment of opposition parties. The election in 2001 was marked by administrative problems with three parties filing a legal petition challenging the election of ruling party candidate Levy MWANAWASA. The new president launched an anticorruption investigation in 2002 to probe high-level corruption during the previous administration. In 2006-07 this task force successfully prosecuted four cases including a landmark civil case in the UK in which former President CHILUBA and numerous others were found liable for USD 41 million. MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election that was deemed free and fair.

Privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability and spur economic growth. Copper output has increased steadily since 2004 due to higher copper prices and foreign investment. In 2005 Zambia qualified for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative consisting of approximately USD 6 billion in debt relief. Zambia experienced a bumper harvest in 2007 which helped to boost GDP and agricultural exports and contain inflation. Although poverty continues to be significant problem in Zambia its economy has strengthened featuring single-digit inflation a relatively stable currency decreasing interest rates and increasing levels of trade.

Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945 Austria's status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation recognized Austria's independence and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country's ""perpetual neutrality"" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality.

Its economy features a large service sector a sound industrial sector and a small but highly developed agricultural sector. Following several years of solid foreign demand for Austrian exports and record employment growth the global economic downturn in 2008 led to a recession that is likely to persist through 2009. The government's stabilization measures could increase the budget deficit to about 2.8% of GDP in 2009 and above 3% in 2010 from about 0.6% in 2008. The Austrian economy has benefited greatly in the past from strong commercial relations especially in the banking and insurance sectors with central eastern and southeastern Europe but these sectors have been vulnerable to recent international financial instabilities and some of Austria's largest banks have required government support. Even after the global economic outlook improves Austria will need to continue restructuring emphasizing knowledge-based sectors of the economy and encouraging greater labor flexibility and greater labor participation to offset its aging population and exceedingly low fertility rate.,9768000,2007,976 (Margravate of Austria established); 17 September 1156 (Duchy of Austria founded); 11 August 1804 (Austrian Empire proclaimed); 12 November 1918 (republic proclaimed),2767000000,2007 est.,9658000000,2007 est.,8436000000,2007 est.,2.0,2001 census,$ 10 520 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,28500000000.0,2007 est.,0.7,NA,$ 504 800 000 000,31 December 2007,,,1576335.0,2009 est.,National Day 26 October (1955); note - commemorates the passage of the law on permanent neutrality,4,2008,115.0,NA,landslides; avalanches; earthquakes,slightly smaller than Maine,98.0,NA,79.5,2009 est.,bicameral Federal Assembly or Bundesversammlung consists of Federal Council or Bundesrat (62 seats; members chosen by state parliaments with each state receiving 3 to 12 members in proportion to its population; members serve five- or six-year terms) and the National Council or Nationalrat (183 seats; members elected by direct popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: National Council - last held 28 September 2008 (next to be held by September 2013) election results: National Council - percent of vote by party - SPOe 29.3% OeVP 26% FPOe 17.5% BZOe 10.7% Greens 10.4% other 6.1%; seats by party - SPOe 57 OeVP 51 FPOe 34 BZOe 21 Greens 20,civil law system with Roman law origin; judicial review of legislative acts by the Constitutional Court; separate administrative and civil/penal supreme courts; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACCT (observer) ADB (nonregional member) AfDB (nonregional member) Australia Group BIS BSEC (observer) CE CEI CERN EAPC EBRD EIB EMU ESA EU FAO G-9 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IEA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MINURSO NAM (guest) NEA NSG OAS (observer) OECD OIF (observer) OPCW OSCE Paris Club PCA PFP Schengen Convention SECI (observer) UN UNCTAD UNDOF UNESCO UNFICYP UNHCR UNIDO UNOMIG UNTSO UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WEU (observer) WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO ZC,,,1944834.0,2008 est.,0.9,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants Air Pollution-Sulfur 85 Air Pollution-Sulphur 94 Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds Antarctic Treaty Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands Whaling signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,some forest degradation caused by air and soil pollution; soil pollution results from the use of agricultural chemicals; air pollution results from emissions by coal- and oil-fired power stations and industrial plants and from trucks transiting Austria between northern and southern Europe,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,59310000000,2007 est.,6399,2008,Enns Krems Linz Vienna,16.0,NA,2.4,2008 est.,in the west and south mostly mountains (Alps); along the eastern and northern margins mostly flat or gently sloping,general assessment: highly developed and efficient domestic: fixed-line subscribership has been in decline since the mid-1990s with mobile-cellular subscribership eclipsing it by the late 1990s; the fiber-optic net is very extensive; all telephone applications and Internet services are available international: country code - 43; satellite earth stations - 15; in addition there are about 600 VSATs (very small aperture terminals) (2007),1.39,2009 est.,3.8,2008 est.,federal republic,three equal horizontal bands of red (top) white and red; the flag design is certainly one of the oldest - if not the oldest - national banners in the world; according to tradition following a fierce battle in the Third Crusade Duke Leopold V of Austria's white tunic became completely blood-spattered; upon removal of his wide belt or sash a white band was revealed; the red-white-red color combination was subsequently adopted as his banner,transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin and South American cocaine destined for Western Europe; increasing consumption of European-produced synthetic drugs,$ 168 900 000 000,2008 est.,107262,2006,0.05,2009 est.,1.6,2008 est.,1.0,2007,$ 325 000 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador (vacant); Charge d'Affaires Scott F.

Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 75% of the population. Mineral deposits including copper gold and oil account for nearly two-thirds of export earnings. The government of Prime Minister SOMARE has expended much of its energy remaining in power. He was the first prime minister ever to serve a full five-year term. The government also brought stability to the national budget largely through expenditure control; however it relaxed spending constraints in 2006 and 2007 as elections approached. Numerous challenges still face the government including regaining investor confidence restoring integrity to state institutions promoting economic efficiency by privatizing moribund state institutions and balancing relations with Australia its former colonial ruler. Other socio-cultural challenges could upend the economy including a worsening HIV/AIDS epidemic currently the highest rate in all of East Asia and the Pacific and chronic law and order and land tenure issues. Australia supplied more than $300 million in aid in FY07/08 which accounts for nearly 20% of the national budget. A consortium led by a major American oil company hopes to begin the commercialization of the country's estimated 227 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves through the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facility by 2010.

In December 1999 a military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history - overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular protest forced him to step aside and brought Laurent GBAGBO into power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the military launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002. Rebel forces claimed the northern half of the country and in January 2003 were granted ministerial positions in a unity government under the auspices of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord. President GBAGBO and rebel forces resumed implementation of the peace accord in December 2003 after a three-month stalemate but issues that sparked the civil war such as land reform and grounds for citizenship remained unresolved. In March 2007 President GBAGBO and former New Force rebel leader Guillaume SORO signed the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. As a result of the agreement SORO joined GBAGBO's government as Prime Minister and the two agreed to reunite the country by dismantling the zone of confidence separating North from South integrate rebel forces into the national armed forces and hold elections.

Consequently the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for these products and to a lesser extent in climatic conditions. Despite government attempts to diversify the economy it is still heavily dependent on agriculture and related activities engaging roughly 68% of the population. Since 2006 oil and gas production have become more important engines of economic activity than cocoa. According to IMF statistics earnings from oil and refined products were $1.3 billion in 2006 while cocoa-related revenues were $1 billion during the same period. Cote d'Ivoire's offshore oil and gas production has resulted in substantial crude oil exports and provides sufficient natural gas to fuel electricity exports to Ghana Togo Benin Mali and Burkina Faso. Oil exploration by a number of consortiums of private companies continues offshore and President GBAGBO has expressed hope that daily crude output could reach 200 000 barrels per day (b/d) by the end of the decade. Since the end of the civil war in 2003 political turmoil has continued to damage the economy resulting in the loss of foreign investment and slow economic growth. GDP grew by nearly 2% in 2007 and 3% in 2008.

The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917 which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962.

Economic growth for the past seven years has averaged slightly over 8% significantly above the regional average of about 3.7% for that same period; however it has slowed down this year to about 5% and is expected to slow further with the global downturn. Growth has been fueled by investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) petrochemicals and steel. Additional petrochemical aluminum and plastics projects are in various stages of planning. Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources but it also supplies manufactured goods notably food and beverages as well as cement to the Caribbean region. Oil and gas account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports but only 5% of employment. The country is also a regional financial center and tourism is a growing sector although it is not proportionately as important as in many other Caribbean islands. The economy benefits from a growing trade surplus. The MANNING administration has benefited from fiscal surpluses fueled by the dynamic export sector; however declines in oil and gas prices have reduced government revenues which will challenge his government's commitment to maintaining high levels of public investment.,1008000,2007,31 August 1962 (from the UK),18100000000,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,20800000000,2007 est.,1.4,2000 census,$ 5 395 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,2.9,NA,$ 3 730 000 000,31 December 2007,,,271677.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 31 August (1962),9,2008,0.0,NA,outside usual path of hurricanes and other tropical storms,slightly smaller than Delaware,98.6,2003 est.,70.86,2009 est.,bicameral Parliament consists of the Senate (31 seats; 16 members appointed by the ruling party 9 by the President 6 by the opposition party to serve a maximum term of five years) and the House of Representatives (41 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: House of Representatives - last held on 5 November 2007 (next to be held in 2012) election results: House of Representatives - percent of vote - PNM 46% UNC 29.7%; seats by party - PNM 26 UNC 15 note: Tobago has a unicameral House of Assembly with 12 members serving four-year terms; last election held in January 2005; seats by party - PNM 11 DAC 1,based on English common law; judicial review of legislative acts in the Supreme Court; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ACP C Caricom CDB FAO G-24 G-77 IADB IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC ISO ITSO ITU ITUC LAES MIGA NAM OAS OPANAL OPCW UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,264225.0,2008 est.,0.3,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Marine Life Conservation Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,water pollution from agricultural chemicals industrial wastes and raw sewage; oil pollution of beaches; deforestation; soil erosion,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,7704000000,2007,,,Point Fortin Point Lisas Port-of-Spain,18.0,NA,4.1,2008 est.,mostly plains with some hills and low mountains,general assessment: excellent international service; good local service domestic: mobile-cellular teledensity exceeds 125 telephones per 100 persons international: country code - 1-868; submarine cable systems provide connectivity to US and parts of the Caribbean and South America; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean); tropospheric scatter to Barbados and Guyana,1.72,2009 est.,5.5,2008 est.,parliamentary democracy,red with a white-edged black diagonal band from the upper hoist side to the lower fly side,transshipment point for South American drugs destined for the US and Europe; producer of cannabis,$ 9 843 000 000,2008 est.,8320,2000,-0.1,2009 est.,3.5,2008 est.,,,$ 24 190 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Roy L.

A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE the nation's first prime minister has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has dominated the country's political system since independence. His chaotic land redistribution campaign which began in 2000 caused an exodus of white farmers crippled the economy and ushered in widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure his reelection. The ruling ZANU-PF party used fraud and intimidation to win a two-thirds majority in the March 2005 parliamentary election allowing it to amend the constitution at will and recreate the Senate which had been abolished in the late 1980s. In April 2005 Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order ostensibly an urban rationalization program which resulted in the destruction of the homes or businesses of 700 000 mostly poor supporters of the opposition. President MUGABE in June 2007 instituted price controls on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store shelves empty for months. General elections held in March 2008 contained irregularities but still amounted to a censure of the ZANU-PF-led government with significant gains in opposition seats in parliament. MDC opposition leader Morgan TSVANGIRAI won the presidential polls and may have won an out right majority but official results posted by the Zimbabwe Electoral Committee did not reflect this. In the lead up to a run-off election in late June 2008 considerable violence enacted against opposition party members led to the withdrawal of TSVANGIRAI from the ballot. Extensive evidence of vote tampering and ballot-box stuffing resulted in international condemnation of the process. Difficult negotiations over a power sharing agreement allowing MUGABE to remain as president and creating the new position of prime minister for TSVANGIRAI were finally settled in February 2009.,10.0,1996,platinum cotton tobacco gold ferroalloys textiles/clothing,578.96,31 December 2007,16.19,July 2009 est.,270.0,2008,$ 4 548 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,8 provinces and 2 cities* with provincial status; Bulawayo* Harare* Manicaland Mashonaland Central Mashonaland East Mashonaland West Masvingo Matabeleland North Matabeleland South Midlands,20.0,1987,4.21,2002,corn cotton tobacco wheat coffee sugarcane peanuts; sheep goats pigs,Zimbabwe Defense Forces (ZDF): Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) (2009),31.49,2009 est.,4.6,2000,$ 941 600,2008 est.,tropical; moderated by altitude; rainy season (November to March),machinery and transport equipment other manufactures chemicals fuels,African National Party or ANP [Egypt DZINEMUNHENZVA]; Movement for Democratic Change or MDC [Morgan TSVANGIRAI Arthur MUTAMBARA splinter faction]; Peace Action is Freedom for All or PAFA; United Parties [Abel MUZOREWA]; United People's Party or UPP [Daniel SHUMBA]; Zimbabwe African National Union-Ndonga or ZANU-Ndonga [Wilson KUMBULA]; Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front or ZANU-PF [Robert Gabriel MUGABE]; Zimbabwe African Peoples Union or ZAPU [Agrippa MADLELA]; Zimbabwe Youth in Alliance or ZIYA,11392629,July 2009 est.,noun: Zimbabwean(s) adjective: Zimbabwean,coal chromium ore asbestos gold nickel copper iron ore vanadium lithium tin platinum group metals,,,landlocked; the Zambezi forms a natural riverine boundary with Zambia; in full flood (February-April) the massive Victoria Falls on the river forms the world's largest curtain of falling water,Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition [Xolani ZITHA]; National Constitutional Assembly or NCA [Lovemore MADHUKU]; Women of Zimbabwe Arise or WOZA [Jenny WILLIAMS]; Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions or ZCTU [Wellington CHIBEBE],The government of Zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult economic problems as it struggles with an unsustainable fiscal deficit an overvalued official exchange rate hyperinflation and bare store shelves. Its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy. The government's land reform program characterized by chaos and violence has badly damaged the commercial farming sector the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 400 000 jobs turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products. The EU and the US provide food aid on humanitarian grounds. Badly needed support from the IMF has been suspended because of the government's arrears on past loans and the government's unwillingness to enact reforms that would stabilize the economy. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe routinely prints money to fund the budget deficit causing the official annual inflation rate to rise from 32% in 1998 to 133% in 2004 585% in 2005 past 1 000% in 2006 and 26 000% in November 2007 and to 11.2 million percent in 2008.

European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US UK France and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western economic and security organizations the EC which became the EU and NATO while the Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then Germany has expended considerable funds to bring Eastern productivity and wages up to Western standards.

At 1.3% in 2008 GDP growth is expected to be negative in 2009. Recent stimulus and lender relief efforts will make demands on Germany's federal budget and undercut plans to balance its budget by 2011. The reforms launched by the former government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHOEDER deemed necessary due to chronically high unemployment and low average growth led to strong growth in 2007 while unemployment in 2008 fell below 8% a new post-reunification low. Germany's aging population combined with high chronic unemployment has pushed social security outlays to a level exceeding contributions but higher government revenues from the cyclical upturn in 2006-07 and a 3% rise in the value-added tax cut Germany's budget deficit to within the EU's 3% debt limit in 2007. The current government of Chancellor Angela MERKEL has initiated other reform measures such as a gradual increase in the mandatory retirement age from 65 to 67 and measures to increase female participation in the labor market. The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy - where unemployment still exceeds 30% in some municipalities - continues to be a costly long-term process with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $80 billion. While corporate restructuring and growing capital markets have set strong foundations to help Germany meet the longer-term challenges of European economic integration and globalization Germany's export-oriented economy has proved a disadvantage in the context of weak global demand.,97151000,2007,18 January 1871 (German Empire unification);

Fishing offshore financial services and tourism with more than 167 000 visitors in 2007 are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports vulnerability to natural disasters and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands. In response to foreign concerns the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center. In mid-2002 the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism through improved air connections resort development and cruise ship facilities. Agriculture especially livestock farming is a second target for growth.

During the 1950s and 1960s agricultural ""Virgin Lands"" program Soviet citizens were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures. This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians but also some other deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence in 1991 caused many of these newcomers to emigrate. Kazakhstan's economy is larger than those of all the other Central Asian states combined largely due to the country's vast natural resources and a recent history of political stability.

It also has a large agricultural sector featuring livestock and grain. Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these natural resources. Kazakhstan enjoyed double-digit growth in 2000-01 and 8% or more per year in 2002-07 - thanks largely to its booming energy sector but also to economic reform good harvests and increased foreign investment; growth slowed to 3% in 2008 however as a result of declining oil prices and a softening world economy. Inflation reached 10% in 2007 and 17% in 2008. In the energy sector the opening of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium in 2001 from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield to the Black Sea substantially raised export capacity. In 2006 Kazakhstan completed the Atasu-Alashankou portion of an oil pipeline to China that is planned in future construction to extend from the country's Caspian coast eastward to the Chinese border. The country has embarked upon an industrial policy designed to diversify the economy away from overdependence on the oil sector by developing its manufacturing potential. The policy changed the corporate tax code to favor domestic industry as a means to reduce the influence of foreign investment and foreign personnel. The government has engaged in several disputes with foreign oil companies over the terms of production agreements most recently with regard to the Kashagan project in 2007-08.

Its golden age occurred in the 16th century. During the following century the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation. In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 Russia Prussia and Austria partitioned Poland amongst themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union ""Solidarity"" that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency. A ""shock therapy"" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe but Poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure and a poor rural underclass. Solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to the lower house of Parliament and the new leaders of the Solidarity Trade Union subsequently pledged to reduce the Trade Union's political role. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.

In 2008 GDP grew an estimated 4.8% based on rising private consumption a jump in corporate investment and EU funds inflows. GDP per capita is still much below the EU average but is similar to that of the three Baltic states. Since 2004 EU membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major boost to the economy. Unemployment is falling rapidly though at roughly 9.7% in 2008 it remains above the EU average. In 2008 inflation reached 4.3% more than the upper limit of the National Bank of Poland's target range but has been falling due to global economic slowdown. Poland's economic performance could improve further if the country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its business environment. An inefficient commercial court system a rigid labor code bureaucratic red tape and persistent low-level corruption keep the private sector from performing up to its full potential. Rising demands to fund health care education and the state pension system present a challenge to the Polish Government's effort to hold the consolidated public sector budget deficit under 3.0% of GDP a target which was achieved in 2007-08. The PO/PSL coalition government which came to power in November 2007 plans to further reduce the budget deficit with the aim of eventually adopting the euro by 2012. The new government has also announced its intention to enact business-friendly reforms reduce public sector spending growth lower taxes and accelerate privatization. The government however has moved slowly on major reforms.

Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore which account for nearly 40% of total exports. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. Before 2000 drought and economic mismanagement resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In February 2000 Mauritania qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and nearly all of its foreign debt has since been forgiven. In December 2007 donors pledged $2.1 billion at a triennial Consultative Group review. A new investment code approved in December 2001 improved the opportunities for direct foreign investment.

The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of President Askar AKAEV who had run the country since 1990. Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV. The political opposition organized demonstrations in Bishkek in April May and November 2006 resulting in the adoption of a new constitution that transferred some of the president's powers to parliament and the government. In December 2006 the Kyrgyzstani parliament voted to adopt new amendments restoring some of the presidential powers lost in the November 2006 constitutional change. By late-September 2007 both previous versions of the constitution were declared illegal and the country reverted to the AKAEV-era 2003 constitution which was subsequently modified in a flawed referendum initiated by BAKIEV. The president then dissolved parliament called for early elections and gained control of the new parliament through his newly-created political party Ak Jol in December 2007 elections.

Cotton tobacco wool and meat are the main agricultural products although only tobacco and cotton are exported in any quantity. Industrial exports include gold mercury uranium natural gas and electricity. Following independence Kyrgyzstan was progressive in carrying out market reforms such as an improved regulatory system and land reform. Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. Much of the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991 but by mid-1995 production began to recover and exports began to increase. The economy is heavily weighted toward gold export and a drop in output at the main Kumtor gold mine sparked a 0.5% decline in GDP in 2002 and a 0.6% decline in 2005. The government made steady strides in controlling its substantial fiscal deficit nearly closing the gap between revenues and expenditures in 2006 before boosting expenditures more than 20% in 2007-08. The government and international financial institutions have been engaged in a comprehensive medium-term poverty reduction and economic growth strategy. In 2005 Bishkek agreed to pursue much-needed tax reform and in 2006 became eligible for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. Progress fighting corruption further restructuring of domestic industry and success in attracting foreign investment are keys to future growth. GDP grew more than 6% annually in 2007-08 partly due to higher gold prices internationally but growth is likely to decline from that level in 2009 due to declining demand and lower commodity prices in the wake of the international financial crisis.,2152000,2007,31 August 1991 (from the Soviet Union),0,2007 est.,750000000,2007 est.,768000000,2007 est.,5.0,NA,$ -708 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,1.6,NA,$ 558 300 000,31 December 2007,,,1083777.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 31 August (1991),,,132.0,NA,NA,slightly smaller than South Dakota,98.7,1999 census,69.43,2009 est.,unicameral Supreme Council or Jorgorku Kengesh (90 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: last held 16 December 2007 (next to be held in 2012) election results: Supreme Council - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - Ak Jol 71 Social Democratic Party 11 KCP 8,based on French and Russian laws; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB CIS CSTO EAEC EAPC EBRD ECO FAO GCTU IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO (correspondent) ITSO ITU MIGA MINURCAT NAM (observer) OIC OPCW OSCE PCA PFP SCO UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNMIL UNMIS UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,,,1398878.0,2008 est.,1.4,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Hazardous Wastes Ozone Layer Protection Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,water pollution; many people get their water directly from contaminated streams and wells; as a result water-borne diseases are prevalent; increasing soil salinity from faulty irrigation practices,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,15620000000,2006 est.,470,2008,Balykchy (Ysyk-Kol or Rybach'ye),18.0,NA,10.7,2008 est.,peaks of Tien Shan and associated valleys and basins encompass entire nation,general assessment: telecommunications infrastructure is being upgraded; loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are being used to install a digital network digital radio-relay stations and fiber-optic links domestic: fixed line penetration remains low and concentrated in urban areas; multiple mobile cellular service providers with growing coverage; mobile cellular subscribership reached 40 per 100 persons in 2007 international: country code - 996; connections with other CIS countries by landline or microwave radio relay and with other countries by leased connections with Moscow international gateway switch and by satellite; satellite earth stations - 2 (1 Intersputnik 1 Intelsat); connected internationally by the Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) fiber-optic line (2007),2.65,2009 est.,18.0,2004 est.,republic,red field with a yellow sun in the center having 40 rays representing the 40 Kyrgyz tribes; on the obverse side the rays run counterclockwise on the reverse clockwise; in the center of the sun is a red ring crossed by two sets of three lines a stylized representation of the roof of the traditional Kyrgyz yurt,limited illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium poppy for CIS markets; limited government eradication of illicit crops; transit point for Southwest Asian narcotics bound for Russia and the rest of Europe; major consumer of opiates,$ 3 754 000 000,2008 est.,18500,2003,1.4,2009 est.,6.0,2008 est.,,,$ 11 410 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Tatiana C.

A catastrophic eruption in June 1997 closed the airports and seaports causing further economic and social dislocation. Two-thirds of the 12 000 inhabitants fled the island. Some began to return in 1998 but lack of housing limited the number. The agriculture sector continued to be affected by the lack of suitable land for farming and the destruction of crops.

At independence in September 1991 Macedonia was the least developed of the Yugoslav republics producing a mere 5% of the total federal output of goods and services. The collapse of Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de facto free trade area. An absence of infrastructure UN sanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the country's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth until 1996. GDP subsequently rose each year through 2000. In 2001 during a civil conflict the economy shrank 4.5% because of decreased trade intermittent border closures increased deficit spending on security needs and investor uncertainty. Growth averaged 4% per year during 2003-06 and 5% per year during 2007-08. Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic stability with low inflation but it has so far lagged the region in attracting foreign investment and creating jobs despite making extensive fiscal and business sector reforms. Official unemployment remains high at nearly 35% but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market estimated to be more than 20% of GDP that is not captured by official statistics. In the wake of the global economic downturn Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign direct investment lowered credit and a slowdown of export growth.

Subsequently BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of the islands Diego Garcia contains a joint UK-US naval support facility. All of the remaining islands are uninhabited. Between 1967 and 1973 former agricultural workers earlier residents in the islands were relocated primarily to Mauritius but also to the Seychelles. Negotiations between 1971 and 1982 resulted in the establishment of a trust fund by the British Government as compensation for the displaced islanders known as Chagossians. Beginning in 1998 the islanders pursued a series of lawsuits against the British Government seeking further compensation and the right to return to the territory. In 2006 and 2007 British court rulings invalidated the immigration policies contained in the 2004 BIOT Constitution Order that had excluded the islanders from the archipelago but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia. In 2008 the House of Lords as the final court of appeal in the UK ruled in favor of the British Government by overturning the lower court rulings and finding no right of return on the part of the Chagossians.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tropical marine; hot humid moderated by trade winds,,,,,,coconuts fish sugarcane,,,archipelago of 55 islands; Diego Garcia largest and southernmost island occupies strategic location in central Indian Ocean; island is site of joint US-UK military facility,,All economic activity is concentrated on the largest island of Diego Garcia where a joint UK-US military facility is located.

A large percentage of the population especially in rural areas derives its living from agricultural activity often on a subsistence basis. Because of the importance of the informal sector accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain. On a per capita basis real income has stagnated at 1980 levels. Most observers attribute Paraguay's poor economic performance to political uncertainty corruption limited progress on structural reform and deficient infrastructure. The economy rebounded between 2003 and 2008 however as growing world demand for commodities combined with high prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based export expansion.

For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to enjoy stability and a flowering of its indigenous culture. Following the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 Japan opened its ports and began to intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries Japan became a regional power that was able to defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea Formosa (Taiwan) and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32 Japan occupied Manchuria and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America's entry into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and Southeast Asia. After its defeat in World War II Japan recovered to become an economic power and a staunch ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity elected politicians - with heavy input from bureaucrats and business executives - wield actual decisionmaking power. The economy experienced a major slowdown starting in the 1990s following three decades of unprecedented growth but Japan still remains a major economic power both in Asia and globally.

Today measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis Japan is the third-largest economy in the world after the US and China. Two notable characteristic of the post-war economy were the close interlocking structures of manufacturers suppliers and distributors known as keiretsu and the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor force. Both features are now eroding under the dual pressures of global competition and domestic demographic change. Japan's industrial sector is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. A tiny agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected with crop yields among the highest in the world. Usually self sufficient in rice Japan imports about 60% of its food on a caloric basis. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had been spectacular - a 10% average in the 1960s a 5% average in the 1970s and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s averaging just 1.7% largely because of the after effects of inefficient investment and an asset price bubble in the late 1980s that required a protracted period of time for firms to reduce excess debt capital and labor. In October 2007 Japan's longest post-war period of economic expansion ended after 69 months and Japan entered into recession in 2008 with 2009 marking a return to near 0% interest rates. The 10-year privatization of Japan Post which has functioned not only as the national postal delivery system but also through its banking and insurance facilities as Japan's largest financial institution was completed in October 2007 marking a major milestone in the process of structural reform. The Japanese financial sector was not heavily exposed to sub-prime mortgages or their derivative instruments and weathered the initial effect of the global credit crunch but a sharp downturn in business investment and global demand for Japan's exports in late 2008 pushed Japan further into a recession. Japan's huge government debt which totals 170% of GDP and the aging of the population are two major long-run problems. Debate continues on the role of and effects of reform in restructuring the economy.,107339000,2007,660 B.C.

The country lacked political stability however and experienced a series of military coups during its first decades. Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab Republic. In September 1961 the two entities separated and the Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. In November 1970 Hafiz al-ASAD a member of the Socialist Ba'th Party and the minority Alawite sect seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political stability to the country. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War Syria lost the Golan Heights to Israel. During the 1990s Syria and Israel held occasional peace talks over its return. Following the death of President al-ASAD his son Bashar al-ASAD was approved as president by popular referendum in July 2000. Syrian troops - stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role - were withdrawn in April 2005.

Higher crude oil prices countered declining oil production and led to higher budgetary and export receipts. Damascus has implemented modest economic reforms in the past few years including cutting lending interest rates opening private banks consolidating all of the multiple exchange rates raising prices on some subsidized items most notably gasoline and cement and establishing the Damascus Stock Exchange - which is set to begin operations in 2009. In October 2007 for example Damascus raised the price of subsidized gasoline by 20% then instituted a rationing system in 2008. In addition President ASAD signed legislative decrees to encourage corporate ownership reform and to allow the Central Bank to issue Treasury bills and bonds for government debt. Nevertheless the economy remains highly controlled by the government. Long-run economic constraints include declining oil production high unemployment and inflation rising budget deficits and increasing pressure on water supplies caused by heavy use in agriculture rapid population growth industrial expansion and water pollution.,6700000,2007,17 April 1946 (from League of Nations mandate under French administration),,,0,2007 est.,4400000000,2008 est.,10.0,NA,$ -705 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,1400000000.0,2007,3.1,NA,$ 15 190 000 000,31 December 2007,,,4344895.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 17 April (1946),77,2008,-200.0,NA,dust storms sandstorms,slightly larger than North Dakota,79.6,2004 census,71.19,2009 est.,unicameral People's Council or Majlis al-Shaab (250 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: last held on 22-23 April 2007 (next to be held in 2011) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - NPF 172 independents 78,based on a combination of French and Ottoman civil law; Islamic law is used in the family court system; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ABEDA AFESD AMF CAEU FAO G-24 G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt (signatory) ICRM IDA IDB IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IPU ISO ITSO ITU LAS MIGA NAM OAPEC OIC UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNRWA UNWTO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO,12.0,NA,4966367.0,2008 est.,5.9,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: Environmental Modification,deforestation; overgrazing; soil erosion; desertification; water pollution from raw sewage and petroleum refining wastes; inadequate potable water,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,40500000000,2007,2052,2008,Latakia Tartus,18.0,NA,2.3,2008 est.,primarily semiarid and desert plateau; narrow coastal plain; mountains in west,general assessment: fair system currently undergoing significant improvement and digital upgrades including fiber-optic technology domestic: the number of fixed-line connections has increased markedly since 2000; mobile-cellular service growing rapidly with teledensity reaching 35 wireless telephones per 100 persons in 2007; coaxial cable and microwave radio relay network still in use international: country code - 963; submarine cable connection to Egypt Lebanon and Cyprus; satellite earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) and 1 Intersputnik (Atlantic Ocean region); coaxial cable and microwave radio relay to Iraq Jordan Lebanon and Turkey; participant in Medarabtel,3.12,2009 est.,8.6,2008 est.,republic under an authoritarian military-dominated regime,three equal horizontal bands of red (top) white and black colors associated with the Arab Liberation flag; two small green five-pointed stars in a horizontal line centered in the white band; former flag of the United Arab Republic where the two stars represented the constituent states of Syria and Egypt; similar to the flag of Yemen which has a plain white band Iraq which has an Arabic inscription centered in the white band and that of Egypt which has a gold Eagle of Saladin centered in the white band; the current design dates to 1980,a transit point for opiates hashish and cocaine bound for regional and Western markets; weak anti-money-laundering controls and bank privatization may leave it vulnerable to money laundering,$ 14 490 000 000,2008 est.,97401,2006,2.13,2009 est.,4.8,2008 est.,7.0,2007,$ 95 360 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador (vacant); Charge d'Affaires Maura CONNELLY embassy: Abou Roumaneh Al-Mansour Street No. 2 Damascus mailing address: P.

Burma was administered as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate self-governing colony; independence from the Commonwealth was attained in 1948. Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to 1988 first as military ruler then as self-appointed president and later as political kingpin. In September 1988 the military deposed NE WIN and established a new ruling junta. Despite multiparty legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition party - the National League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a landslide victory the junta refused to hand over power. NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI who was under house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002 was imprisoned in May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest. After the ruling junta in August 2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices tens of thousands of Burmese marched in protest led by prodemocracy activists and Buddhist monks. In late September 2007 the government brutally suppressed the protests killing at least 13 people and arresting thousands for participating in the demonstrations. Since then the regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests. The junta appointed Labor Minister AUNG KYI in October 2007 as liaison to AUNG SAN SUU KYI who remains under house arrest and virtually incommunicado with her party and supporters. Burma in early May 2008 was struck by Cyclone Nargis which official estimates claimed left over 80 000 dead and 50 000 injured. Despite this tragedy the junta proceeded with its May constitutional referendum the first vote in Burma since 1990 setting the stage for the 2010 parliamentary elections.,7.0,2001,natural gas wood products pulses beans fish rice clothing jade and gems,17.0,31 December 2007,9.14,July 2009 est.,558.0,2008,$ 13 700 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,7 divisions (taing-myar singular - taing) and 7 states* (pyi ne-myar singular - pyi ne) divisions: Ayeyarwady Bago Magway Mandalay Sagaing Tanintharyi Yangon states: Chin Kachin Kayah Kayin Mon Rakhine Shan,1045.6,1999,33.23,2000,rice pulses beans sesame groundnuts sugarcane; hardwood; fish and fish products,Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw): Army Navy Air Force (Tatmadaw Lay) (2008),16.97,2009 est.,1.2,2001,$ 1 000 000 000,2008 est.,tropical monsoon; cloudy rainy hot humid summers (southwest monsoon June to September); less cloudy scant rainfall mild temperatures lower humidity during winter (northeast monsoon December to April),fabric petroleum products fertilizer plastics machinery transport equipment; cement construction materials crude oil; food products edible oil,National League for Democracy or NLD [AUNG SHWE AUNG SAN SUU KYI]; National Unity Party or NUP (pro-regime) [TUN YE]; Shan Nationalities League for Democracy or SNLD [HKUN HTUN OO]; and numerous other smaller parties,48137741,July 2009 est.,noun: Burmese (singular and plural) adjective: Burmese,petroleum timber tin antimony zinc copper tungsten lead coal marble limestone precious stones natural gas hydropower,,,strategic location near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes,"Ethnic Nationalities Council or ENC (based in Thailand); Federation of Trade Unions-Burma or FTUB (exile trade union and labor advocates); National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma or NCGUB (self-proclaimed government in exile) [""Prime Minister"" Dr. SEIN WIN] consists of individuals some legitimately elected to the People's Assembly in 1990 (the group fled to a border area and joined insurgents in December 1990 to form parallel government in exile); Kachin Independence Organization or KIO; Karen National Union or KNU; Karenni National People's Party or KNPP; National Council-Union of Burma or NCUB (exile coalition of opposition groups); United Wa State Army or UWSA; Union Solidarity and Development Association or USDA (pro-regime a social and political mass-member organization) [HTAY OO general secretary]; 88 Generation Students (pro-democracy movement) [TOE KYAW HLAING] other: several Shan factions",Burma a resource-rich country suffers from pervasive government controls inefficient economic policies and rural poverty. Despite Burma's increasing oil and gas revenue socio-economic conditions have deteriorated because of the regime's mismanagement of the economy. The economy suffers from serious macroeconomic imbalances - including rising inflation fiscal deficits multiple official exchange rates that overvalue the Burmese kyat a distorted interest rate regime unreliable statistics and an inability to reconcile national accounts to determine a realistic GDP figure. Most overseas development assistance ceased after the junta began to suppress the democracy movement in 1988 and subsequently refused to honor the results of the 1990 legislative elections. In response to the government of Burma's attack in May 2003 on AUNG SAN SUU KYI and her convoy the US imposed new economic sanctions in August 2003 including a ban on imports of Burmese products and a ban on provision of financial services by US persons. Further a poor investment climate hampers the inflow of foreign investment. Foreign investors have shied away from nearly every sector except for natural gas and power generation. The business climate is widely perceived as opaque corrupt and highly inefficient. The most productive sectors will continue to be in extractive industries - especially oil and gas mining and timber - with the latter causing significant environmental degradation. Other areas such as manufacturing and services are struggling with inadequate infrastructure unpredictable import/export policies deteriorating health and education systems and endemic corruption. A major banking crisis in 2003 shuttered 20 private banks and disrupted the economy. As of 2008 the largest private banks operated under tight restrictions limiting the private sector's access to formal credit. The September 2007 crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators including thousands of monks strained the economy as the tourism industry which directly employs about 500 000 people suffered dramatic declines in foreign visitor levels. In November 2007 the European Union announced new sanctions banning investment and trade in Burmese gems timber and precious stones while the United States expanded its sanctions list to include more Burmese government and military officials and their family members as well as prominent regime business cronies their family members and associated companies. Official statistics are inaccurate. In July 2008 the President signed into law the Tom Lantos JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008 imposing new targeted sanctions on the regime. Published statistics on foreign trade are greatly understated because of the size of the black market and unofficial border trade - often estimated to be as large as the official economy. Though the Burmese government has good economic relations with its neighbors better investment and business climates and an improved political situation are needed to promote serious foreign investment exports and tourism.,214200,2006,4 January 1948 (from the UK),9900000000,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,3620000000,2006 est.,1.0,NA,$ 1 018 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2007 est.,2.9,NA,$ 887 700 000 000,31 December 2007,,,9146312.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 4 January (1948); Union Day 12 February (1947),24,2008,0.0,NA,destructive earthquakes and cyclones; flooding and landslides common during rainy season (June to September); periodic droughts,slightly smaller than Texas,89.9,2006 est.,63.39,2009 est.,a unicameral People's Assembly or Pyithu Hluttaw consisting of 485 seats with members elected by popular vote was elected in 1990 but was never seated; according to the terms of the constitution approved on 10 May 2008 a bicameral Pyidaungsu Hluttaw consisting of an upper house with a maximum of 224 seats and a lower house with a maximum of 440 seats will be selected in elections in 2010 elections: last held 27 May 1990 but Assembly never allowed by junta to convene (junta has announced plans to hold elections in 2010) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - NLD 392 (opposition) SNLD 23 (opposition) NUP 10 (pro-government) other 60,based on English common law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB APT ARF ASEAN BIMSTEC CP EAS FAO G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC ISO (correspondent) ITU NAM OPCW (signatory) SAARC (observer) UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UPU WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,13402788.0,2008 est.,2.1,2005 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,deforestation; industrial pollution of air soil and water; inadequate sanitation and water treatment contribute to disease,1.0,2008,2.0,2008,5961000000,2006 est.,3955,2008,Moulmein Rangoon Sittwe,18.0,NA,7.8,2008 est.,central lowlands ringed by steep rugged highlands,general assessment: meets minimum requirements for local and intercity service for business and government domestic: system barely capable of providing basic service; cellular phone system is grossly underdeveloped with a subscribership base of less than 1 per 100 persons international: country code - 95; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 optical telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to Asia the Middle East and Europe; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) and ShinSat (2007),1.89,2009 est.,9.5,2008 est.,military junta,red with a blue rectangle in the upper hoist-side corner bearing 14 white five-pointed stars encircling a cogwheel containing a stalk of rice; the 14 stars represent the seven administrative divisions and seven states,remains world's second largest producer of illicit opium with an estimated production in 2008 of 340 metric tons an increase of 26% and poppy cultivation in 2008 totaled 22 500 hectares a 4% increase from 2007; production in the United Wa State Army's areas of greatest control remains low; Shan state is the source of 94% of Burma's poppy cultivation; lack of government will to take on major narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment against money laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug effort; major source of methamphetamine and heroin for regional consumption (2008),$ 3 427 000 000,2008 est.,27000,2006,0.78,2009 est.,0.9,2008 est.,4.0,2007,$ 55 040 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Charge d'Affaires Larry M.

The economy relies heavily on a narrow range of exports notably bananas and coffee making it vulnerable to natural disasters and shifts in commodity prices; however investments in the maquila and non-traditional export sectors are slowly diversifying the economy. Economic growth remains dependent on the US economy its largest trading partner and will decline in 2009 as a result of reduction in export demand and tightening global credit markets. Remittances represent over a quarter of GDP or nearly three-quarters of exports. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) came into force in 2006 and has helped foster investment. Despite improvements in tax collections the government's fiscal deficit is growing due to increases in current expenditures and financial losses from the state energy and telephone companies.,4185000,2007,15 September 1821 (from Spain),0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,0,2007 est.,3.0,NA,$ -1 977 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,11800000.0,2007 est.,2.9,NA,$ 6 298 000 000,31 December 2007,,,1397938.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 15 September (1821),123,2008,0.0,NA,frequent but generally mild earthquakes; extremely susceptible to damaging hurricanes and floods along the Caribbean coast,slightly larger than Tennessee,80.0,2001 census,69.4,2009 est.,unicameral National Congress or Congreso Nacional (128 seats; members are elected proportionally by department to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 27 November 2005 (next to be held in November 2009) election results: percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - PL 62 PN 55 PUD 5 PDC 4 PINU 2,rooted in Roman and Spanish civil law with increasing influence of English common law; recent judicial reforms include abandoning Napoleonic legal codes in favor of the oral adversarial system; accepts ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,BCIE CACM FAO G-77 IADB IAEA IBRD ICAO ICCt ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS ILO IMF IMO Interpol IOC IOM ISO (subscriber) ITSO ITU ITUC LAES LAIA (observer) MIGA MINURSO NAM OAS OPANAL OPCW PCA RG SICA UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO Union Latina UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,1825770.0,2008 est.,0.6,2006 est.,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands signed but not ratified: none of the selected agreements,urban population expanding; deforestation results from logging and the clearing of land for agricultural purposes; further land degradation and soil erosion hastened by uncontrolled development and improper land use practices such as farming of marginal lands; mining activities polluting Lago de Yojoa (the country's largest source of fresh water) as well as several rivers and streams with heavy metals,2.0,2008,2.0,2008,5753000000,2006 est.,699,2008,La Ceiba Puerto Cortes San Lorenzo Tela,18.0,NA,4.4,2008 est.,mostly mountains in interior narrow coastal plains,general assessment: telecommunications infrastructure is among the least developed in Latin America; fixed-line connections are limited; multiple providers of mobile-cellular services domestic: beginning in 2003 private sub-operators allowed to provide fixed-lines in order to expand telephone coverage; fixed-line teledensity has increased to about 10 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone service has been increasing rapidly and subscribership in 2007 approached 60 per 100 persons international: country code - 504; landing point for both the Americas Region Caribbean Ring System (ARCOS-1) and the MAYA-1 fiber optic submarine cable system that together provide connectivity to South and Central America parts of the Caribbean and the US; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean); connected to Central American Microwave System,3.27,2009 est.,3.5,2008 est.,democratic constitutional republic,three equal horizontal bands of blue (top) white and blue with five blue five-pointed stars arranged in an X pattern centered in the white band; the stars represent the members of the former Federal Republic of Central America - Costa Rica El Salvador Guatemala Honduras and Nicaragua; similar to the flag of El Salvador which features a round emblem encircled by the words REPUBLICA DE EL SALVADOR EN LA AMERICA CENTRAL centered in the white band; also similar to the flag of Nicaragua which features a triangle encircled by the word REPUBLICA DE NICARAGUA on top and AMERICA CENTRAL on the bottom centered in the white band,transshipment point for drugs and narcotics; illicit producer of cannabis cultivated on small plots and used principally for local consumption; corruption is a major problem; some money-laundering activity,$ 10 390 000 000,2008 est.,13600,2000,1.96,2009 est.,4.0,2008 est.,,,$ 33 630 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Hugo LLORENS embassy: Avenida La Paz Apartado Postal No. 3453 Tegucigalpa mailing address: American Embassy APO AA 34022 Tegucigalpa telephone: [504] 236-9320 238-5114 FAX: [504] 238-4357,$ 4 400,2008 est.,0,2007 est.

A devaluation of the peso in late 1994 threw Mexico into economic turmoil triggering the worst recession in over half a century. The nation had been making an impressive recovery until the global financial crisis hit in late 2008. Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages underemployment for a large segment of the population inequitable income distribution and few advancement opportunities for the largely Amerindian population in the impoverished southern states. The elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in government the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

It contains a mixture of modern and outmoded industry and agriculture increasingly dominated by the private sector. Recent administrations have expanded competition in seaports railroads telecommunications electricity generation natural gas distribution and airports. Per capita income is one-fourth that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal. Trade with the US and Canada has nearly tripled since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994. Mexico has 12 free trade agreements with over 40 countries including Guatemala Honduras El Salvador the European Free Trade Area and Japan putting more than 90% of trade under free trade agreements.

A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C. and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C. who in turn were replaced by the Greeks Romans and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 Egypt became an important world transportation hub but also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882 but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922 Egypt acquired full sovereignty with the overthrow of the British-backed monarchy in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world) limited arable land and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's growing population through economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical infrastructure.,17.0,2001 est.,crude oil and petroleum products cotton textiles metal products chemicals,12.51,31 December 2007,5.08,July 2009 est.,3.0,2008,$ 158 300 000 000,2008 est.,$ 59 130 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,$ 12 080 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,26 governorates (muhafazat singular - muhafazah); Ad Daqahliyah Al Bahr al Ahmar (Red Sea) Al Buhayrah (El Beheira) Al Fayyum (El Faiyum) Al Gharbiyah Al Iskandariyah (Alexandria) Al Isma'iliyah (Ismailia) Al Jizah (Giza) Al Minufiyah (El Monofia) Al Minya Al Qahirah (Cairo) Al Qalyubiyah Al Wadi al Jadid (New Valley) As Suways (Suez) Ash Sharqiyah Aswan Asyut Bani Suwayf (Beni Suef) Bur Sa'id (Port Said) Dumyat (Damietta) Janub Sina' (South Sinai) Kafr ash Shaykh Matruh (Western Desert) Qina (Qena) Shamal Sina' (North Sinai) Suhaj (Sohag),86.8,1997,68.3,2000,cotton rice corn wheat beans fruits vegetables; cattle water buffalo sheep goats,Army Navy Air Force Air Defense Command,21.7,2009 est.,4.2,2006,$ 40 220 000 000,2008 est.,desert; hot dry summers with moderate winters,machinery and equipment foodstuffs chemicals wood products fuels,National Democratic Party or NDP (governing party) [Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK]; National Progressive Unionist Grouping or Tagammu [Rifaat EL-SAID]; New Wafd Party or NWP [Mahmoud ABAZA]; Tomorrow Party [Moussa Mustafa MOUSSA] note: formation of political parties must be approved by the government; only parties with representation in elected bodies are listed,83082869,July 2009 est.,noun: Egyptian(s) adjective: Egyptian,petroleum natural gas iron ore phosphates manganese limestone gypsum talc asbestos lead zinc,-0.2,2009 est.,controls Sinai Peninsula only land bridge between Africa and remainder of Eastern Hemisphere; controls Suez Canal a sea link between Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea; size and juxtaposition to Israel establish its major role in Middle Eastern geopolitics; dependence on upstream neighbors; dominance of Nile basin issues; prone to influxes of refugees,Muslim Brotherhood (technically illegal) note: despite a constitutional ban against religious-based parties and political activity the technically illegal Muslim Brotherhood constitutes Hosni MUBARAK's potentially most significant political opposition; MUBARAK has alternated between tolerating limited political activity by the Brotherhood (its members who ran as independents hold 88 seats in the People's Assembly) and blocking its influence; civic society groups are sanctioned but constrained in practical terms; only trade unions and professional associations affiliated with the government are officially sanctioned; Internet social networking groups and bloggers,Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent Egypt is bisected by the highly fertile Nile valley where most economic activity takes place. Egypt's economy was highly centralized during the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but has opened up considerably under former President Anwar EL-SADAT and current President Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK. Cairo has aggressively pursued economic reforms to encourage inflows of foreign investment and facilitate GDP growth. In 2005 Prime Minister Ahmed NAZIF's government reduced personal and corporate tax rates reduced energy subsidies and privatized several enterprises. The stock market boomed and GDP grew about 7% each year since 2006. Despite these achievements the government has failed to raise living standards for the average Egyptian and has had to continue providing subsidies for basic necessities. The subsidies have contributed to a sizeable budget deficit - roughly 7% of GDP in 2007-08 - and represent a significant drain on the economy.

The Southern Lands are now divided into five administrative districts two of which are archipelagos Iles Crozet and Iles Kerguelen; the third is a district composed of two volcanic islands Ile Saint-Paul and Ile Amsterdam; the fourth Iles Eparses consists of five scattered tropical islands around Madagascar. They contain no permanent inhabitants and are visited only by researchers studying the native fauna scientists at the various scientific stations fishermen and military personnel. The fifth district is the Antarctic portion which consists of ""Adelie Land "" a thin slice of the Antarctic continent discovered and claimed by the French in 1840. Ile Amsterdam: Discovered but not named in 1522 by the Spanish the island subsequently received the appellation of Nieuw Amsterdam from a Dutchman; it was claimed by France in 1843. A short-lived attempt at cattle farming began in 1871. A French meteorological station established on the island in 1949 is still in use. Ile Saint Paul: Claimed by France since 1893 the island was a fishing industry center from 1843 to 1914. In 1928 a spiny lobster cannery was established but when the company went bankrupt in 1931 seven workers were abandoned. Only two survived until 1934 when rescue finally arrived. Iles Crozet: A large archipelago formed from the Crozet Plateau Iles Crozet is divided into two main groups: L'Occidental (the West) which includes Ile aux Cochons Ilots des Apotres Ile des Pingouins and the reefs Brisants de l'Heroine; and L'Oriental (the east) which includes Ile d'Est and Ile de la Possession (the largest island of the Crozets). Discovered and claimed by France in 1772 the islands were used for seal hunting and as a base for whaling. Originally administered as a dependency of Madagascar they became part of the TAAF in 1955. Iles Kerguelen: This island group discovered in 1772 is made up of one large island (Ile Kerguelen) and about 300 smaller islands. A permanent group of 50 to 100 scientists resides at the main base at Port-aux-Francais. Adelie Land: The only non-insular district of the TAAF is the Antarctic claim known as ""Adelie Land."" The US Government does not recognize it as a French dependency. Bassas da India: A French possession since 1897 this atoll is a volcanic rock surrounded by reefs and is awash at high tide. Europa Island: This heavily wooded island has been a French possession since 1897; it is the site of a small military garrison that staffs a weather station. Glorioso Islands: A French possession since 1892 the Glorioso Islands are composed of two lushly vegetated coral islands (Ile Glorieuse and Ile du Lys) and three rock islets. A military garrison operates a weather and radio station on Ile Glorieuse. Juan de Nova Island: Named after a famous 15th century Spanish navigator and explorer the island has been a French possession since 1897. It has been exploited for its guano and phosphate. Presently a small military garrison oversees a meteorological station. Tromelin Island: First explored by the French in 1776 the island came under the jurisdiction of Reunion in 1814.

Various paramilitary bands resisted Nazi Germany's occupation and division of Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1945 but fought each other and ethnic opponents as much as the invaders. The military and political movement headed by Josip TITO (Partisans) took full control of Yugoslavia when German and Croatian separatist forces were defeated in 1945. Although Communist TITO's new government and his successors (he died in 1980) managed to steer their own path between the Warsaw Pact nations and the West for the next four and a half decades. In 1989 Slobodan MILOSEVIC became president of the Serbian Republic and his ultranationalist calls for Serbian domination led to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines. In 1991 Croatia Slovenia and Macedonia declared independence followed by Bosnia in 1992. The remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in April 1992 and under MILOSEVIC's leadership Serbia led various military campaigns to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring republics into a ""Greater Serbia."" These actions led to Yugoslavia being ousted from the UN in 1992 but Serbia continued its - ultimately unsuccessful - campaign until signing the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. MILOSEVIC kept tight control over Serbia and eventually became president of the FRY in 1997. In 1998 an ethnic Albanian insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of Kosovo provoked a Serbian counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. The MILOSEVIC government's rejection of a proposed international settlement led to NATO's bombing of Serbia in the spring of 1999 and to the eventual withdrawal of Serbian military and police forces from Kosovo in June 1999. UNSC Resolution 1244 in June 1999 authorized the stationing of a NATO-led force (KFOR) in Kosovo to provide a safe and secure environment for the region's ethnic communities created a UN interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to foster self-governing institutions and reserved the issue of Kosovo's final status for an unspecified date in the future. In 2001 UNMIK promulgated a constitutional framework that allowed Kosovo to establish institutions of self-government and led to Kosovo's first parliamentary election. FRY elections in September 2000 led to the ouster of MILOSEVIC and installed Vojislav KOSTUNICA as president. A broad coalition of democratic reformist parties known as DOS (the Democratic Opposition of Serbia) was subsequently elected to parliament in December 2000 and took control of the government. DOS arrested MILOSEVIC in 2001 and allowed for him to be tried in The Hague for crimes against humanity. (MILOSEVIC died in March 2006 before the completion of his trial.) In 2001 the country's suspension from the UN was lifted. In 2003 the FRY became Serbia and Montenegro a loose federation of the two republics with a federal level parliament. Widespread violence predominantly targeting ethnic Serbs in Kosovo in March 2004 caused the international community to open negotiations on the future status of Kosovo in January 2006. In May 2006 Montenegro invoked its right to secede from the federation and - following a successful referendum - it declared itself an independent nation on 3 June 2006. Two days later Serbia declared that it was the successor state to the union of Serbia and Montenegro. A new Serbian constitution was approved in October 2006 and adopted the following month. After 15 months of inconclusive negotiations mediated by the UN and four months of further inconclusive negotiations mediated by the US EU and Russia on 17 February 2008 the UNMIK-administered province of Kosovo declared itself independent of Serbia.",24.0,2002,manufactured goods food and live animals machinery and transport equipment,11.13,31 December 2007,13.86,2009 est.,323.0,2008,$ 52 180 000 000,2008 est.,$ 11 950 000 000,2006 est.,,,167 municipalities (opcstine singular - opcstina) Serbia Proper: Belgrade City (Beograd): Barajevo Cukarica Grocka Lazarevac Mladenovac Novi Beograd Obrenovac Palilula Rakovica Savski Venac Sopot Stari Grad Surcin Vozdovac Vracar Zemun Zvezdara; Bor: Bor Kladovo Majdanpek Negotin; Branicevo: Golubac Kucevo Malo Crnice Petrovac Pozarevac Veliko Gradiste Zabari Zagubica; Grad Nis: Crveni Krst Mediana Niska Banja Palilula Pantelej Jablanica: Bojnik Crna Trava Lebane Leskovac Medveda Vlasotince; Kolubara: Lajkovac Ljig Mionica Osecina Ub Valjevo; Macva: Bogatic Koceljeva Krupanj Ljubovija Loznica Mali Zvornik Sabac Vladimirci; Moravica: Cacak Gornkji Milanovac Ivanjica Lucani; Nisava: Aleksinac Doljevac Gadzin Han Merosina Nis Razanj Svrljig; Pcinja: Bosilegrad Bujanovac Presevo Surdulica Trgoviste Vladicin Han Vranje; Pirot: Babusnica Bela Palanka Dimitrovgrad Pirot; Podunavlje: Smederevo Smederevskia Palanka Velika Plana; Pomoravlje: Cuprija Despotovac Jagodina Paracin Rekovac Svilajnac; Rasina: Aleksandrovac Brus Cicevac Krusevac Trstenik Varvarin; Raska: Kraljevo Novi Pazar Raska Tutin Vrnjacka Banja; Sumadija: Arandelovac Batocina Knic Kragujevac Lapovo Raca Topola; Toplica: Blace Kursumlija Prokuplje Zitorada; Zajecar: Boljevac Knjazevac Sokobanja Zajecar; Zlatibor: Arilje Bajina Basta Cajetina Kosjeric Nova Varos Pozega Priboj Prijepolje Sjenica Uzice Vojvodina Autonomous Province: South Backa: Bac Backa Palanka Backi Petrovac Becej Beocin Novi Sad Sremski Karlovci Srobobran Temerin Titel Vrbas Zabalj; South Banat: Alibunar Bela Crkva Kovacica Kovin Opovo Pancevo Plandiste Vrsac; North Backa: Backa Topola Mali Idjos Subotica; North Banat: Ada Coka Kanjiza Kikinda Novi Knezevac Senta; Central Banat: Nova Crnja Novi Becej Secanj Zitiste Zrenjanin; Srem: Indija Irig Pecinci Ruma Sid Sremska Mitrovica Stara Pazova; West Backa: Apatin Kula Odzaci Sombor,208.5,2003,,,wheat maize sugar beets sunflower raspberries beef pork milk,Serbian Armed Forces (Vojska Srbije VS): Land Forces Command (includes Riverine Component consisting of a river flotilla on the Danube) Joint Operations Command Air and Air Defense Forces Command (2009),9.19,2009 est.,,,$ 9 600 000 000,2007 est.,in the north continental climate (cold winters and hot humid summers with well distributed rainfall); in other parts continental and Mediterranean climate (relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall and hot dry summers and autumns),,Coalition of Albanians of the Presevo Valley or KAPD [Riza HALIMI]; Coalition for Sandzak or KZS [Sulejman UGLJANIN]; Democratic Party of Albanians or PDSh [Ragmi MUSTAFA]; Democratic Party of Serbia or DSS [Vojislav KOSTUNICA]; Democratic Party or DS [Boris TADIC]; Democratic Union of the Valley or BDL [Skender DESTANI]; For a European Serbia [Boris TADIC]; Force of Serbia Movement or PSS [Bogoljub KARIC]; G17 Plus [Mladjan DINKIC]; League of Vojvodina Hungarians or SVM [Istvan PASTOR]; Liberal Democratic Party or LDP [Cedomir JOVANOVIC]; Movement for Democratic Progress or LPD [Jonuz MUSLIU]; New Serbia or NS [Velimir ILIC]; Party of Democratic Action or PVD [Riza HALIMI]; People's Party or NS [Maja GOJKOVIC]; Roma Party or RP [Srdjan SAJN]; Serbian Progressive Party or SNS [Tomislav NIKOLIC]; Serbian Radical Party or SRS [Vojislav SESELJ (currently on trial at The Hague) with Dragan TODOROVIC as acting leader]; Socialist Party of Serbia or SPS [Ivica DACIC]; Union of Roma of Serbia or URS [Rajko DJURIC],7379339,July 2009 est.,noun: Serb(s) adjective: Serbian,oil gas coal iron ore copper zinc antimony chromite gold silver magnesium pyrite limestone marble salt arable land,0.0,2008 est.,controls one of the major land routes from Western Europe to Turkey and the Near East,NA,MILOSEVIC-era mismanagement of the economy an extended period of international economic sanctions and the damage to Yugoslavia's infrastructure and industry during the NATO airstrikes in 1999 left the economy only half the size it was in 1990. After the ousting of former Federal Yugoslav President MILOSEVIC in September 2000 the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition government implemented stabilization measures and embarked on a market reform program. After renewing its membership in the IMF in December 2000 Yugoslavia continued to reintegrate into the international community by rejoining the World Bank (IBRD) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). A World Bank-European Commission sponsored Donors' Conference held in June 2001 raised $1.3 billion for economic restructuring. In November 2001 the Paris Club agreed to reschedule the country's $4.5 billion public debt and wrote off 66% of the debt. In July 2004 the London Club of private creditors forgave $1.7 billion of debt just over half the total owed. Belgrade has made progress in trade liberalization and enterprise restructuring and privatization including telecommunications and small- and medium-size firms. It has made halting progress towards EU membership despite signing a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Brussels in May 2008. Serbia is also pursuing membership in the World Trade Organization.

AZALI seized power in a bloodless coup and helped negotiate the 2000 Fomboni Accords power-sharing agreement in which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands and each island maintains its own local government. AZALI won the 2002 Presidential election and each island in the archipelago elected its own president. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI was elected to office. In 2007 BACAR effected Anjouan's de-facto secession from the Union refusing to step down in favor of fresh Anjouanais elections when Comoros' other islands held legitimate elections in July.

At its zenith the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two World Wars and the Irish republic withdraw from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation.

Agriculture is intensive highly mechanized and efficient by European standards producing about 60% of food needs with less than 2% of the labor force. The UK has large coal natural gas and oil resources but its oil and natural gas reserves are declining and the UK became a net importer of energy in 2005; energy industries now contribute about 4% to GDP. Services particularly banking insurance and business services account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while industry continues to decline in importance. Since emerging from recession in 1992 Britain's economy enjoyed the longest period of expansion on record during which time growth outpaced most of Western Europe. The global economic slowdown tight credit and falling home prices however pushed Britain back into recession in the latter half of 2008 and prompted the BROWN government to implement a number of new measures to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial markets; these include part-nationalizing the banking system cutting taxes suspending public sector borrowing rules and bringing forward public spending on capital projects. The Bank of England periodically coordinates interest rate moves with the European Central Bank but Britain remains outside the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and opinion polls show a majority of Britons oppose joining the euro.,71992000,2007,1927;

Not until 1840 was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands. Several exploration ""firsts"" were achieved in the early 20th century. Following World War II there was an upsurge in scientific research on the continent. A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations camps and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims but not all countries recognize these claims. In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in 1959 it entered into force in 1961.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,severe low temperatures vary with latitude elevation and distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below freezing,,,,,,iron ore chromium copper gold nickel platinum and other minerals and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small uncommercial quantities; none presently exploited; krill finfish and crab have been taken by commercial fisheries,,,the coldest windiest highest (on average) and driest continent; during summer more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an equivalent period; mostly uninhabitable,,Fishing off the coast and tourism both based abroad account for Antarctica's limited economic activity.

Following the latter's defeat in 1949 Greece joined NATO in 1952. A military dictatorship which in 1967 suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country lasted seven years.

Tourism provides 15% of GDP. Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force mainly in agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP. The Greek economy grew by nearly 4.0% per year between 2003 and 2007 due partly to infrastructural spending related to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games and in part to an increased availability of credit which has sustained record levels of consumer spending. But growth dropped to 2.8% in 2008 as a result of the world financial crisis and tightening credit conditions. Greece violated the EU's Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criteria of no more than 3% of GDP from 2001 to 2006 but finally met that criteria in 2007-08. Public debt inflation and unemployment are above the euro-zone average but are falling. The Greek Government continues to grapple with cutting government spending reducing the size of the public sector and reforming the labor and pension systems in the face of often vocal opposition from the country's powerful labor unions and the general public. The economy remains an important domestic political issue in Greece and while the ruling New Democracy government has had some success in improving economic growth and reducing the budget deficit Athens faces long-term challenges in its effort to continue its economic reforms especially social security reform and privatization.,11997000,2007,1829 (from the Ottoman Empire),0,2007 est.,4100000000,2007 est.,4069000000,2007 est.,0.7,NA,$ -51 530 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,5894000000.0,2007 est.,0.6,NA,$ 365 900 000 000,31 December 2007,,,2050289.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 25 March (1821),869,2008,0.0,NA,severe earthquakes,slightly smaller than Alabama,96.0,2001 census,79.66,2009 est.,unicameral Parliament or Vouli ton Ellinon (300 seats; members are elected by direct popular vote to serve four-year terms) elections: last held 16 September 2007 (next to be held by 2011) election results: percent of vote by party - ND 41.8% PASOK 38.1% KKE 8.2% Synaspismos 5% LAOS 3.8% other 3.1%; seats by party - ND 152 PASOK 102 KKE 22 Synaspismos 14 LAOS 10,based on codified Roman law; judiciary divided into civil criminal and administrative courts; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations,Australia Group BIS BSEC CE CERN EAPC EBRD EIB EMU ESA EU FAO IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICCt ICRM IDA IEA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MINURSO NAM (guest) NATO NEA NSG OAS (observer) OECD OIF OPCW OSCE PCA Schengen Convention SECI UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNHCR UNIDO UNIFIL UNMIS UNOMIG UNWTO UPU WCO WEU WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO ZC,12.0,NA,2517273.0,2008 est.,4.3,2005 est.,party to: Air Pollution Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides Air Pollution-Sulfur 94 Antarctic-Environmental Protocol Antarctic-Marine Living Resources Antarctic Treaty Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Marine Dumping Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Tropical Timber 83 Tropical Timber 94 Wetlands signed but not ratified: Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds,air pollution; water pollution,3.0,2008,5.0,2008,59330000000,2007 est.,2548,2008,Agioitheodoroi Aspropyrgos Pachi Piraeus Thessaloniki,18.0,NA,3.2,2008 est.,mostly mountains with ranges extending into the sea as peninsulas or chains of islands,general assessment: adequate modern networks reach all areas; good mobile telephone and international service domestic: microwave radio relay trunk system; extensive open-wire connections; submarine cable to offshore islands international: country code - 30; landing point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 optical telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to Europe Middle East and Asia; a number of smaller submarine cables provide connectivity to various parts of Europe the Middle East and Cyprus; tropospheric scatter; satellite earth stations - 4 (2 Intelsat - 1 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean 1 Eutelsat and 1 Inmarsat - Indian Ocean region),1.37,2009 est.,7.7,2008 est.,parliamentary republic,nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white; there is a blue square in the upper hoist-side corner bearing a white cross; the cross symbolizes Greek Orthodoxy the established religion of the country,a gateway to Europe for traffickers smuggling cannabis and heroin from the Middle East and Southwest Asia to the West and precursor chemicals to the East; some South American cocaine transits or is consumed in Greece; money laundering related to drug trafficking and organized crime,$ 93 910 000 000,2008 est.,117533,2005,0.13,2009 est.,2.8,2008 est.,9.0,2007,$ 343 600 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Daniel V.

Buddhism was introduced in about the mid-third century B.C. and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th century a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in northern Sri Lanka. The coastal areas of the island were controlled by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century. The island was ceded to the British in 1796 became a crown colony in 1802 and was united under British rule by 1815. As Ceylon it became independent in 1948; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972. Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983. Tens of thousands have died in the ethnic conflict that continues to fester. After two decades of fighting the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) formalized a cease-fire in February 2002 with Norway brokering peace negotiations. Violence between the LTTE and government forces intensified in 2006 and the government regained control of the Eastern Province in 2007. In May 2009 the government announced that its military had finally defeated the remnants of the LTTE and that its leader Velupillai PRABHAKARAN had been killed.,26.1,30 September 2008 est.,textiles and apparel tea and spices; diamonds emeralds rubies; coconut products rubber manufactures fish,,,6.13,July 2009 est.,,,$ 38 000 000 000,2008 est.,$ 250 200 000 000,31 December 2008 est.,,,8 provinces; Central North Central North Eastern North Western Sabaragamuwa Southern Uva Western note: in October 2006 a Sri Lankan Supreme Court ruling voided a presidential directive merging the North and Eastern Provinces; many have defended the merger as a prerequisite for a negotiated settlement to the ethnic conflict; a parliamentary decision on the issue is pending,50.0,1999,12.61,2000,rice sugarcane grains pulses oilseed spices tea rubber coconuts; milk eggs hides beef; fish,Sri Lanka Army Sri Lanka Navy Sri Lanka Air Force (2009),16.26,2009 est.,,,$ 7 800 000 000,2009 est.,tropical monsoon; northeast monsoon (December to March); southwest monsoon (June to October),textile fabrics mineral products petroleum foodstuffs machinery and transportation equipment,All Ceylon Tamil Congress or ACTC [G.PONNAMBALAM]; Ceylon Workers Congress or CWC [Arumugam THONDAMAN]; Communist Party or CP [D.

Recent changes in government however have brought some policy reversals. Currently the ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party has a more statist economic approach which seeks to reduce poverty by steering investment to disadvantaged areas developing small and medium enterprises promoting agriculture and expanding the already enormous civil service. The government has halted privatizations. Although suffering a brutal civil war that began in 1983 Sri Lanka saw GDP growth average 4.5% in the last 10 years with the exception of a recession in 2001. In late December 2004 a major tsunami took about 31 000 lives left more than 6 300 missing and 443 000 displaced and destroyed an estimated $1.5 billion worth of property. Government spending on development and fighting the LTTE drove GDP growth to about 7% per year in 2006-07 before the global recession slow growth in 2008 but high government spending and high oil and commodity prices also raised inflation to around 15% in 2008. Sri Lanka's most dynamic sectors now are food processing textiles and apparel food and beverages port construction telecommunications and insurance and banking. In 2008 plantation crops made up only about 20% of exports (compared with more than 90% in 1970) while textiles and garments accounted for more than 40%. About 1.5 million Sri Lankans work abroad 90% of them in the Middle East. They send home more than $2.5 billion a year. The 25-year civil conflict between LTTE and the government of Sri Lanka has been a serious impediment to economic activities. By mid February 2009 the LTTE remained in control of small and shrinking area in the North. The conflict continues to cast a shadow over the economy.,7983000,2007,4 February 1948 (from the UK),0,2008 est.,,,0,2008 est.,6.2,NA,$ -3 052 000 000,2008 est.,,,,,,,,,0.0,2008 est.,0.5,NA,$ 14 820 000 000,31 December 2007,,,4498667.0,2009 est.,Independence Day 4 February (1948),26,2008,0.0,NA,occasional cyclones and tornadoes,slightly larger than West Virginia,90.7,2001 census,75.14,2009 est.,unicameral Parliament (225 seats; members elected by popular vote on the basis of an open-list proportional representation system by electoral district to serve six-year terms) elections: last held on 2 April 2004 (next to be held by 2010) election results: percent of vote by party or electoral alliance - SLFP and JVP (no longer in United People's Freedom Alliance) 45.6% UNP 37.8% TNA 6.8% JHU 6% SLMC 2% UPF 0.5% EPDP 0.3% other 1%; seats by party - UNP 68 SLFP 57 JVP 39 TNA 22 CWC 8 JHU 7 SLMC 6 SLMC dissidents 4 Communist Party 2 JHU dissidents 2 LSSP 2 MEP 2 NUA 2 UPF 2 EPDP 1 UNP dissident 1,a highly complex mixture of English common law Roman-Dutch Kandyan and Jaffna Tamil law; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction,ADB BIMSTEC C CP FAO G-15 G-24 G-77 IAEA IBRD ICAO ICC ICRM IDA IFAD IFC IFRCS IHO ILO IMF IMO IMSO Interpol IOC IOM IPU ISO ITSO ITU ITUC MIGA MINURSO MINUSTAH MONUC NAM OAS (observer) OPCW PCA SAARC SACEP UN UNCTAD UNESCO UNIDO UNMIS UNWTO UPU WCL WCO WFTU WHO WIPO WMO WTO,12.0,NA,5458720.0,2008 est.,2.6,2006,party to: Biodiversity Climate Change Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol Desertification Endangered Species Environmental Modification Hazardous Wastes Law of the Sea Ozone Layer Protection Ship Pollution Wetlands signed but not ratified: Marine Life Conservation,deforestation; soil erosion; wildlife populations threatened by poaching and urbanization; coastal degradation from mining activities and increased pollution; freshwater resources being polluted by industrial wastes and sewage runoff; waste disposal; air pollution in Colombo,1.0,2008,1.0,2008,9814000000,2007 est.,1449,2007,Colombo,18.0,NA,5.9,2008 est.,mostly low flat to rolling plain; mountains in south-central interior,general assessment: telephone services have improved significantly and are available in most parts of the country domestic: national trunk network consists mostly of digital microwave radio relay; fiber-optic links now in use in Colombo area and fixed wireless local loops have been installed; competition is strong in mobile cellular systems and mobile cellular subscribership is increasing international: country code - 94; the SEA-ME-WE-3 and SEA-ME-WE-4 submarine cables provide connectivity to Asia Australia Middle East Europe US; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Indian Ocean),1.99,2009 est.,5.2,30 September 2008 est.,republic,yellow with two panels; the smaller hoist-side panel has two equal vertical bands of green (hoist side) and orange; the other panel is a large dark red rectangle with a yellow lion holding a sword and there is a yellow bo leaf in each corner; the yellow field appears as a border around the entire flag and extends between the two panels,,$ 12 260 000 000,2008 est.,97286,2003,0.9,2009 est.,6.0,2008 est.,,,$ 91 900 000 000,2008 est.,chief of mission: Ambassador Robert O.

Mining accounts for 8% of GDP but provides more than 50% of foreign exchange earnings. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium and the producer of large quantities of lead zinc tin silver and tungsten. The mining sector employs only about 3% of the population while about half of the population depends on subsistence agriculture for its livelihood. Namibia normally imports about 50% of its cereal requirements; in drought years food shortages are a major problem in rural areas. A high per capita GDP relative to the region hides one of the world's most unequal income distributions. The Namibian economy is closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian dollar pegged one-to-one to the South African rand. Increased payments from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) put Namibia's budget into surplus in 2007 for the first time since independence but SACU payments will decline after 2008 as part of a new revenue sharing formula.

Through fiscal discipline and sound management Botswana has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $13 300 in 2008. Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best credit risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of the expansion and currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP and for 70-80% of export earnings. Tourism financial services subsistence farming and cattle raising are other key sectors. On the downside the government must deal with high rates of unemployment and poverty. Unemployment officially was 23.8% in 2004 but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. HIV/AIDS infection rates are the second highest in the world and threaten Botswana's impressive economic gains.

Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit lime oil honey and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and a financial services industry although the International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses.
